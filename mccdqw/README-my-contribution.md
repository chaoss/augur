For this project, I worked on the testing coverage metric. This metric was under the risk category from Augur and what it essentially does is uses tests on subroutines and statements within a repo in order to gain better insight on how well that particular repo was tested. The percentage values that were calculated were then utilized through the display of a pie chart for different repos. Unfortunately, there was no data to actually extract when the call was made, so we had to manually input data in order to display something to the user.
