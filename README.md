## About Augur

We welcome new developers!  We are prototyping a new installation on our `dev` branch now, so if something breaks or seems weird, we will respond quickly if you email us here: p9j0r6s0m4a0t8v5@augurlabs.slack.com ... Drops straight into our Slack channel for support!

Augur is focused on prototyping open source software metrics.
