## About Augur

Augur is focused on prototyping open source software metrics. 

Functionally, Augur is a prototyped implementation of the Linux Foundation's [CHAOSS Project](http://chaoss.community) on [open source software metrics](https://github.com/CHAOSS/metrics). Technically, Augur is a [Flask Web Application](http://augurlabs.io), [Python library](https://osshealth.github.io/augur/python/build/html/index.html) and [REST server](https://osshealth.github.io/augur/api/index.html) that presents metrics on open source software development project health and sustainability. Hosting the Augur project requires 

## Installing Augur 

 - The [GHTorrent database](http://ghtorrent.org/downloads.html). 
    - You can use the *much smaller [MSR14 dataset](http://ghtorrent.org/msr14.html) for a quick look or to perform development.  

To **get Augur up and running quickly**, install our docker image. [Installation Instructions for Docker Image of Augur](./docker-install.md)

To **contribute to our code base routinely**, we recommended that developers configure Augur on their local workstations. Get started with our [Installation Instructions for Developers](./dev-install.md), and then check out our [development guide](./DEV-GUIDE.md)

**Both configurations require a MariaDB database with a subset of the GHTorrent dataset**
