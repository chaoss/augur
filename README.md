Augur is a Python library and REST server that provides data related to GitHub repositories. Hosting the Augur project requires a copy of the [GHTorrent database](http://ghtorrent.org/downloads.html).

Augur is under heavy development; expect frequent backwards-incompatible changes until a 1.x.x release!
