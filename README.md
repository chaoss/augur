GHData is a Python library and REST server that provides data related to GitHub repositories. Hosting GHData project requires the GHTorrent database. [Backups of this database are avaliable](http://ghtorrent.org/downloads.html) and [it can be synchronized with current data](https://github.com/OSSHealth/ghtorrent-sync). Support for all event types reported by the [GitHub Events API](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/) are planned for the version 1.0.0 milestone.

GHData is under heavy development; expect frequent backwards-incompatible changes until a 1.x.x release!

Dependencies
------------

- Python 3.4.x
- MySQL 5.x or later version (can be on a separate machine)
- GHTorrent in database (can be installed with `ghdata install --historical` on Linux/OS X machines)
  - 50GB download, requires ~1TB free space for the database

Optional:
- Running version of GHTorrent (can be installed with `ghtorrent install`)
  - Requires Ruby and Git

Python libraries:
- All Python dependencies are handled automatically by `pip`.


Installation
------------

### Step 1 - Download and install

To install stable version: `pip install --upgrade https://github.com/OSSHealth/ghdata/archive/master.zip`

To install development version: `pip install --upgrade https://github.com/OSSHealth/ghdata/archive/dev.zip`

### Step 2 (Optional if using command line arguments) - Change the default configuration

The command to create the default configuration file is not yet working.

### Step 3 (Optional if you are able to get the full database) - Install a small, local testing database

Go to: http://ghtorrent.org/msr14.html

Download the MySQL database dump

Extract it (for example using 7-zip)

Extracted file will be named msr14-mysql

The site provides instructions on how to restore it.  Here are some alternate instructions:

  Rename the extracted file to end with .sql
  
  Create a new schema/database
  
  Import the extracted file into the new schema (For example, use MySQL Workbench by clicking Server -> Data Import and then following the instructions in the wizard)

Usage
-----

To run GHData as a server: 
  1. Type `ghdata`. A config file will be generated. 
  2. Edit the ghdata.cfg file with your database settings. 
  3. Type `ghdata` again to start the server.


To use as a Python package:
```
from ghdata import GHData

client = GHData('mysql+pymysql://<user>:<pass>@<host>:<port>/<database name>')
railsID = client.repoid(owner='rails', repo='rails')
railsStars = client.stargazers(railsID)
```
