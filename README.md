## About Augur

We welcome new developers!  We are prototyping a new installation on our `dev` branch now, so if something breaks or seems weird, we will respond quickly if you email us here: p9j0r6s0m4a0t8v5@augurlabs.slack.com ... Drops straight into our Slack channel for support! 

Augur is focused on prototyping open source software metrics. 

Functionally, Augur is a prototyped implementation of the Linux Foundation's [CHAOSS Project](http://chaoss.community) on [open source software metrics](https://github.com/chaoss/metrics). Technically, Augur is a [Flask web application](http://augurlabs.io), [Python library](http://augur.augurlabs.io/static/docs/) and [REST server](http://augur.augurlabs.io/static/api_docs/) that presents metrics on open source software development project health and sustainability.
