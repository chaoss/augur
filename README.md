## About Augur

Augur is focused on prototyping open source software metrics. 

Functionally, Augur is a prototyped implementation of the Linux Foundation's [CHAOSS Project](http://chaoss.community) on [open source software metrics](https://github.com/chaoss/metrics). Technically, Augur is a [Flask Web Application](http://augurlabs.io), [Python library](https://chaoss.github.io/augur/python/build/html/index.html) and [REST server](https://chaoss.github.io/augur/api/index.html) that presents metrics on open source software development project health and sustainability. 

## Installing Augur 

#### Dependencies
 - Python 3.6 or higher
 - The [GHTorrent database](http://ghtorrent.org/downloads.html). 
    - You can use the *much* smaller [MSR14 dataset](http://ghtorrent.org/msr14.html) for a quick look or to perform development.
 - A [GitHub Access Token (no write access required)](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

#### Docker Installation
To get Augur up and running quickly, [install our Docker image](http://augur.augurlabs.io/static/docs/docker-install.html).

#### Local Installation
To contribute to our code base routinely, we recommended that developers configure Augur on their local workstations. Start [here](http://augur.augurlabs.io/static/docs/dev-guide/1-overview.html) to get a primer on the project, or jump straight into our [installation instructions](http://augur.augurlabs.io/static/docs/dev-guide/2-install.html) for developers.

**Both configurations require a connection to a MariaDB database with a subset of the GHTorrent dataset** 

## Augur Development
To contribute to Augur, check out our [development guide](http://augur.augurlabs.io/static/docs/dev-guide/1-overview.html) and [notes on making contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md). Also, please note our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We want Augur to be a welcoming development community that is open for everyone.
