Augur is a Python library and REST server that provides data related to GitHub repositories. Hosting the Augur project requires a copy of the [GHTorrent database](http://ghtorrent.org/downloads.html).

Augur is under heavy development; expect frequent backwards-incompatible changes until a 1.x.x release!



Roadmap
-------
This project is a software prototype implementation of CHAOSS Metrics. The process for defining new metrics is located here: https://github.com/chaoss/metrics 

Our technical, outreach, and academic goals [roadmap](https://github.com/OSSHealth/augur/wiki/Release-Schedule).



Installation with Docker (easy to get up and running)
-----------------------------------------------------
Before we begin, make sure you have everything you need installed: [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), and a MySQL server with [GHTorrent](https://github.com/gousiosg/github-mirror/tree/master/sql) loaded.

Now, to install:

1.  Clone the repo and enter its directory:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OSSHealth/augur
    cd augur
      ```


2.  Set the following variables in your environment:

    ```bash
    # Most likely required
    AUGUR_DB_USER
    AUGUR_DB_PASS
    AUGUR_DB_HOST
    AUGUR_DB_PORT
    AUGUR_DB_NAME

    # Optional
    AUGUR_HOST
    AUGUR_PORT
    AUGUR_PUBLIC_WWW_API_KEY
    AUGUR_GITHUB_API_KEY
    AUGUR_LIBRARIESIO_API_KEY
    AUGUR_DEBUG
    AUGUR_GHTORRENT_PLUS_USER
    AUGUR_GHTORRENT_PLUS_PASS
    AUGUR_GHTORRENT_PLUS_HOST
    AUGUR_GHTORRENT_PLUS_PORT
    AUGUR_GHTORRENT_PLUS_NAME
    ```

    docker-compose will automatically pass the relevant variables from the local environment to the container.


3.  Build the container with `docker-compose build`
4.  Launch the container with `docker-compose up`



Installation without Docker (recommended for developers)
---------------------------
### Dependencies
- Python 3.4.x/Python 2.7.x and `pip`
- Static web server such as nginx or Apache
- a MySQL 5.x database or later with the [GHTorrent database](http://ghtorrent.org/)
  - You can use the [MSR14 dataset](http://ghtorrent.org/msr14.html) for testing
  - Our Development team has a public read only database you can request access to
  - If you want to install your own copy of the MSR14 dataset [Installation instructions](https://github.com/gousiosg/github-mirror/tree/master/sql)
- a MySQL 5.x database with write access

After restoring GHTorrent (or msr14) to MySQL, it is recommended you create a user for Augur. Augur only needs `SELECT` privileges.

Once the database is set up, clone Augur
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OSSHealth/augur/
cd augur && pip install -U .
```
Copy the files in [augur repo]/frontend/public to your webserver:

Run `augur` to create the configuration file (augur.cfg). Edit the file to reflect your database credentials.

Run `augur` to start the backend. Visit your front


Developer Installation
----------------------

### Dependencies
- Python 3.4.x and Python 2.7.x with `pip2` and `pip3`
- MySQL 5.x or later with the [GHTorrent database](http://ghtorrent.org/)
  - You can use the [MSR14 dataset](http://ghtorrent.org/msr14.html) for testing
- NodeJS 7.x or newer

#### Ubuntu
```
   ## Python Installs on UBUNUTU
   sudo apt-get install python-pip
   sudo apt-get install python3-pip

   ## For Development you need NodeJS
   sudo apt-get install nodejs
```

First, clone the repo and checkout the dev branch:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OSSHealth/augur/ && cd augur && git checkout dev
```

Install the Python and Node developer dependencies:
```bash
make install-dev
```

Make sure you have a database user that has select access to the database where you installed [GHTorrent](http://ghtorrent.org/) and all priviledges on another database for Augur.

```sql
CREATE USER 'augur'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT SELECT ON ghtorrent.* TO 'augur'@'localhost';

CREATE DATABASE augur;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEDGES ON augur.* TO 'augur'@'localhost';
```

Run `augur` to create an `augur.cfg` file. Edit this file with the the required information. In addition to your database information, you will need a [GitHub](https://developer.github.com/v3/) API Key, [PublicWWW](https://publicwww.com/) API Key, and [LibrariesIO](https://libraries.io/) API Key.

You're ready to rock! To start both the frontend and backend, run:
 ```bash
 make dev
 ```
 
After making your changes, run `make build` to update the docs and frontend before adding them to your staging area.

For futher instructions on how to add to Augur, here are guides to adding an endpoint to the full stack.

[Dev Guide Part 2](docs/dev-guide-pt2.md)

Frontend development guide coming soon!

macOS High Sierra (and possibly older OS X Versions) Errata:
If you check the logs/frontend.log and find that "brunch" was not found: 
```bash
brew install npm
npm install -g brunch
brew install yarn
```

If the logs look good but the webpage at localhost:3333 is empty, it could be that Yarn installed the wrong version of some libraries. In that case:

```bash
cd frontend 
npm install
```
