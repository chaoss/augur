## About Augur

Augur is focused on prototyping open source software metrics. 

Functionally, Augur is a prototyped implementation of the Linux Foundation's [CHAOSS Project](http://chaoss.community) on [open source software metrics](https://github.com/CHAOSS/metrics). Technically, Augur is a [Flask Web Application](http://augurlabs.io), [Python library](https://osshealth.github.io/augur/python/build/html/index.html) and [REST server](https://osshealth.github.io/augur/api/index.html) that presents metrics on open source software development project health and sustainability. Hosting the Augur project requires 



## Installing Augur 

#### Dependencies
 - The [GHTorrent database](http://ghtorrent.org/downloads.html). 
    - You can use the *much* smaller [MSR14 dataset](http://ghtorrent.org/msr14.html) for a quick look or to perform development.
 - A [GitHub Access Token (no write access required)](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

#### Docker Installation
To get Augur up and running quickly, [install our Docker image](./docs/docker-install.md).

#### Local Installation
To contribute to our code base routinely, we recommended that developers configure Augur on their local workstations. Get started with our [installation instructions for developers](docs/dev-install.md), and then check out our [development guide](docs/dev-guide/dev-guide-overview.md)

**Both configurations require a MariaDB database with a subset of the GHTorrent dataset** 



## Augur Development
To contribute to Augur, check out our [tutorial](docs/tutorial.md), [development guide](docs/dev-guide/dev-guide-overview.md) and [notes on making contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md). Also, please note our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We want Augur to be a welcoming development community that is open for everyone.
