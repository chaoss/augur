Augur is a Python library and REST server that provides data related to GitHub repositories. Hosting the Augur project requires a copy of the [GHTorrent database](http://ghtorrent.org/downloads.html).

Augur is in active development. The tool is focused on prototyping open source software metrics. 

To **get Augur up and running quickly**, install our docker image. [Installation Instructions for Docker Image of Augur](./docker-install.md)

To **contribute to our code base routinely**, we recommended that developers configure Augur on their local workstations.  [Installation Instructions for Developers](./dev-install.md)

**Both configurations require a MariaDB database with a subset of the GHTorrent dataset** 
  - [MySQL]/MariaDB or later with the [GHTorrent database](http://ghtorrent.org/)
  - You can use the [MSR14 dataset](http://ghtorrent.org/msr14.html) for testing
