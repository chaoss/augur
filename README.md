## What is Augur?

Augur is a tool for collecting and measuring structured data
about free (https://www.fsf.org/about/) and [open source](https://opensource.org/docs/osd) (FOSS) communities. 

We gather trace data for a group of repositories, normalize
it into our data model, and provide a variety of metrics about said
data. The structure of our data model enables us to synthesize data
across various platforms to provide meaningful context for meaningful
questions about the way these communities evolve.

We are a [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community>) project, and many of our
metrics are implementations of the metrics defined by our awesome community. You
can find more information about how to get involved
(here)[https://chaoss.community/participate/].

## Collecting Data

One of Augur's core tenets is a desire to openly gather data that people can trust, and then provide useful and well-defined metrics that help give important context to the larger story being told by that data. We do this in a variety of ways, one of which is doing all our own data collection in house. We currently collect data from 4 main sources:

1. Raw Git commit logs (commits, contributors)
2. GitHub's API (issues, pull requests, contributors, repository metadata)
3. The Linux Foundation's [Core Infrastructure Initiative](https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/) API (repository metadata)
4. [Succinct Code Counter](https://github.com/boyter/scc), a blazingly fast Sloc, Cloc, and Code tool that also performs COCOMO calculations

This data is collected by dedicated data collection workers controlled by Augur, each of which is responsible for some querying some subset of the aforementioned data sources. While we only have these 4 at the current moment, we are hard at work building workers for new data sources. If you have an idea for a new one, please tell us - we'd love your help!


## Getting Started

If you're interested in collecting data with our tool, the Augur team has worked hard to develop a detailed guide to getting started with our project, which can be found [here](https://oss-augur.readthedocs.io/en/master/getting-started/toc.html) alongside our main documentation.

If you're looking to contribute to Augur's code, you can find installation instructions, development guides, architecture references (coming soon), best practices and more in our [developer documentation](https://oss-augur.readthedocs.io/en/master/development-guide/toc.html).


## Contributing

To contribute to Augur, please follow the guidelines found in our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Augur is a welcoming community that is open to all, regardless if you're working on your 1000th contribution to open source or your 1st. We strongly believe that much of what makes open source so great is the incredible communitites it brings together, so we invite you to join ours!
