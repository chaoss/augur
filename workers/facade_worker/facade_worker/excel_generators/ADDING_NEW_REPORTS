The scripts in this directory are used to automatically generate Excel files.
They are intended to provide a focused view of the data, such as tables with
combined statistics (e.g., projects across the X axis, affiliations down the Y
axis, LoC added with number of contributors in parenthesis as the data, with one
year on each spreadsheet. These files are stashed in the files/ directory for
download.

To create a new summary file with custom data, copy example.py and modify the
SQL statements. You'll know you have it right when you run the new generator
script directly and it drops a correct Excel file in the files/ directory.

To automatically regenerate the Excel file each time facade-worker.py runs,
first ensure that your file runs without errors. Then change its name to:
	"generate-<your file name>.py"
