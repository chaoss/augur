# augur_view

HTML frontend for Chaoss/Augur, written with Bootstrap and served by Flask

To run as a local instance:

1. [setup a virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv)
    - `python3 -m venv env`
    - `source env/bin/activate`
2. Make sure you have the requirements installed
    - `pip3 install flask pyyaml urllib3`
3. Run the app
    - `./run.sh`

Once the server is running, you can change the default `serving` url in `config.yml` and either restart the app or navigate to `[approot]/settings/reload` in the browser to connect to the desired augur instance.

For installation instructions on a server, see [installing](installing.md).
