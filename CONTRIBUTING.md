# How to Contribute

We love pull requests from everyone.

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/augur.git

Make your change.

When you are done making changes, run `make docs` to rebuild the documentation.

Push to your fork.

Then, [submit a pull request](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/compare)

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests
within three business days (and, typically, one business day).

Please note we require all commits to be signed off with a [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) in accordance with the [CHAOSS Project Charter section 8.2.1](https://chaoss.community/about/charter/#user-content-8-intellectual-property-policy). This can be easily done by using the `-s` flag when using `git commit`. For example: `git commit -s -m "Update README.md"`.
