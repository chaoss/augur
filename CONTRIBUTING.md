# How to Contribute

We love pull requests from everyone.

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/ghdata.git

Make your change and push to your fork. Then, [submit a pull request][pr].

[pr]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl_rails/compare/

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests
within three business days (and, typically, one business day).

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Inform the [mailing list][ml] of your pull request.
* Use [Markdown][md] (we can fix this for you)
