# How to Contribute

We love pull requests from everyone.

We do our best to follow the standard Git workflow of `fork -> change -> pull request -> merge -> update fork -> change ... (repeat forever)`.

In more detail:

0. Fork the [main repo](https://github.com/chaoss/augur), then clone it:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:your-username/augur.git
```
1. Follow the instructions outlined in the [README.md](README.md) to get started.
2. Make your change(s). Check [here](https://oss-augur.readthedocs.io/en/master/) for documentation for the whole development process!
3. Push to your fork.
4. Then, [submit a pull request](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/compare).

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests
within three business days (and, typically, one business day). Once one of our maintainers has had a chance to review your PR, we will either mark it as "needs review" and provide specific feedback on your changes, or we will go ahead and complete the pull request.

Please note we require all commits to be signed off with a [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) in accordance with the [CHAOSS Project Charter section 8.2.1](https://chaoss.community/about/charter/#user-content-8-intellectual-property-policy). This can be easily done by using the `-s` flag when using `git commit`. For example: `git commit -s -m "Update README.md"`. **Any pull requests containing commits that are not signed off will be marked as "Work in Progress" and will not be eligible for merge until all commits are signed off.**
