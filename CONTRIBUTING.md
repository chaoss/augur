# How to Contribute

We love to pull requests from everyone! We follow the standard Git workflow of `fork -> change -> pull request -> merge -> update fork -> change ... (repeat forever)`.

If you are new to open source, we recommend GitHub's excellent guide on "[How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)". In addition, please feel free to reach out to any of the maintainers or other community members if you are struggling as we are here to help you learn!

Before getting started, please make sure you've read the [README](README.md) to get a primer on our project. Augur's documentation can be found [here](https://oss-augur.readthedocs.io/en/main/).
## Your Journey from Newcomer to Confident Contributor
New to open source or Augur? Here's how most people get started. Go at your own pace.
### 1. Join the Community & Learn How Things Work
- **Join Slack**: Go to the [CHAOSS Community getting started guide](https://chaoss.community/kb-getting-started/) to join the community Slack workspace and introduce yourself in `#wg-augur-8knot`.
- **Read CHAOSS Docs**: Look at the [Code of Conduct](https://chaoss.community/code-of-conduct/) and browse the [CHAOSS website](https://chaoss.community/)
- **Review this CONTRIBUTING.md**: Get familiar with our contribution guidelines and current project policies
- **Attend Meetings**: Check the [CHAOSS calendar](https://chaoss.community/chaoss-calendar/) for meetings like:
  - Newcomer Hangout
  - Community Call
  - Augur/8-Knot Software Working Group 
- **Watch Recordings**: Find past meetings on the [CHAOSS YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CHAOSStube)
- **Request a Tour Guide** (Optional): Not sure where to start? Ask in the `#newcomers` Slack channel for 1:1 help
### 2. Run Augur
- **Read the Docs**: Start at [Augur documentation](https://oss-augur.readthedocs.io/en/main/) (check out the Docker setup guide)
- **Install Augur**: Follow the installation instructions [getting-started-guide](https://oss-augur.readthedocs.io/en/main/getting-started/toc.html) to get it running on your machine
- **Getting Started Video**: Set up and run Augur on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXLnWwwSsSE)
### 3. Start with Good First Issues
1. Go to the [issues page](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/issues).
2. Use the **Labels** filter to narrow down issues:
   - [`good first issue`](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/labels/good%20first%20issue) — recommended for new contributors.
   - [`first-timers-only`](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/issues?q=state%3Aopen+label%3Afirst-timers-only) — specifically for first-time contributions.
3. Choose an issue that looks manageable and interesting.
4. If you find a bug or something unclear, open an issue or ask for guidance before starting work.
### 4. Need Help?
- Ask questions in the Slack workspace linked above.
- Bring questions to community meetings.
- Comment on the issue or PR you're working on.
### 5. Ready for More?
- Try [`challenging first issue`](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/labels/challenging%20first%20issue) labels
- Look at [`documentation`](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/labels/documentation) or [`tech debt`](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/labels/tech%20debt) issues
- Ask in the Slack workspace linked above what would be a good fit for your interests.

## Contributing to the source code

1. Fork and clone this repo:
```bash
$ git clone github.com:your-username/augur.git
$ cd augur/
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/chaoss/augur.git
```

2. Follow the [development installation instructions](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/blob/main/docs/new-install.md).

3. Create a new branch
```bash
$ git checkout -b my-new-branch
```

4. Make your change(s).

5. Commit the change(s) and push to your fork
```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -s -m "This is my first commit"
$ git push -u origin my-new-branch
```
6. Then, [submit a pull request](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/compare).

At this point, you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests within three business days (and, typically, one business day).
Once one of our maintainers has had a chance to review your PR, we will either mark it as ```needs review``` and provide specific feedback on your changes, or we will go ahead and complete the pull request.

## Signing-off on Commits
To contribute to this project, you must agree to the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) (DCO) by the [CHAOSS charter](https://chaoss.community/about/charter/#user-content-8-intellectual-property-policy) for each commit you make. The DCO is a simple statement that you, as a contributor, have the legal right to make the contribution.
To signify that you agree to the DCO for contributions, you simply add a line to each of your git commit messages. For example:
```
Signed-off-by: Jane Smith <jane.smith@example.com>
```

This can be easily done by using the `-s` flag when running the `git commit` command,

```
$ git commit -s -m “my commit message w/signoff”
```

To ensure all your commits are signed, you may choose to [configure git](https://gist.github.com/xavierfoucrier/c156027fcc6ae23bcee1204199f177da) properly by editing your global ```.gitconfig```

**Any pull requests containing commits that are not signed off will not be eligible for merge until the commits have been signed off.** 

## Keeping in sync with the Augur Repository

Remember to sync your fork with the ```main``` branch regularly, by taking the following steps:

- Setup your upstream branch to point to the URL of the main Augur repo ```https://github.com/chaoss/augur.git```.

- Next, in the root folder of the project, on the ```main``` branch, run:
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/chaoss/augur.git
```
Whenever you need to make changes, make sure your ```main``` branch is in sync with the main repository, by checking out to the ```main``` branch and running:
```
git pull upstream main
git push origin master
```
