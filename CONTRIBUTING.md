# How to Contribute

We love pull requests from everyone.

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/augur.git

Make your change.

When you are done making changes, run `make docs` to rebuild the documentation.

Push to your fork.

Then, [submit a pull request](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/compare)

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests
within three business days (and, typically, one business day).
