* resolve alias ([98d4e63](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/less-loader/commit/98d4e63))


### Chores

* **dependencies:** Update peer dependencies ([24a6f66](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/less-loader/commit/24a6f66))


### Features

* **source-maps:** refactor source maps handling ([895044f](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/less-loader/commit/895044f))
* allow user to choose between resolvers ([1d6e505](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/less-loader/commit/1d6e505))

* remove root option ([39ad4f8](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/less-loader/commit/39ad4f8))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* If you've already configured your `resolve.alias` with a `.less` extension, you can now remove that wrong extension.
* The root option was never documented, so it's very unlikely that this is actually a breaking change. However, since the option was removed, we need to flag this as breaking.
* **dependencies:** Require webpack 2 as peer dependency
* **source-maps:** Since the map is now passed as an object to the next loader, this could potentially break if another loader than the css-loader is used. The css-loader accepts both.
