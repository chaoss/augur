 * ```
 * import {NgIterable} from '@angular/core';
 *
 * class NgForOf<T, U extends NgIterable<T>> {}
 * ```
 *
 * Here, the generic type parameters `T` and `U` can be emitted into a different context, as the
 * type reference to `NgIterable` originates from an absolute module import so that it can be
 * emitted anywhere, using that same module import. The process of emitting translates the
 * `NgIterable` type reference to a type reference that is valid in the context in which it is
 * emitted, for example:
 *
 * ```
 * import * as i0 from '@angular/core';
 * import * as i1 from '@angular/common';
 *
 * const _ctor1: <T, U extends i0.NgIterable<T>>(o: Pick<i1.NgForOf<T, U>, 'ngForOf'>):
 * i1.NgForOf<T, U>;
 * ```
 *
 * Notice how the type reference for `NgIterable` has been translated into a qualified name,
 * referring to the namespace import that was created.
