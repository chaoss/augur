/**
 * An implementation of the `DependencyTracker` dependency graph API.
 *
 * The `FileDependencyGraph`'s primary job is to determine whether a given file has "logically"
 * changed, given the set of physical changes (direct changes to files on disk).
 *
 * A file is logically changed if at least one of three conditions is met:
 *
 * 1. The file itself has physically changed.
 * 2. One of its dependencies has physically changed.
 * 3. One of its resource dependencies has physically changed.

     * Update the current dependency graph from a previous one, incorporating a set of physical
     * changes.
     *
     * This method performs two tasks:
     *
     * 1. For files which have not logically changed, their dependencies from `previous` are added to
     *    `this` graph.
     * 2. For files which have logically changed, they're added to a set of logically changed files
     *    which is eventually returned.
     *
     * In essence, for build `n`, this method performs:
     *
     * G(n) + L(n) = G(n - 1) + P(n)
     *
     * where:
     *
     * G(n) = the dependency graph of build `n`
     * L(n) = the logically changed files from build n - 1 to build n.
     * P(n) = the physically changed files from build n - 1 to build n.
