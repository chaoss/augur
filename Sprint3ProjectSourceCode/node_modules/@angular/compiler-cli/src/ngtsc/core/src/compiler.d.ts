 * The heart of the Angular Ivy compiler.

 * compiler. Each instance of `NgCompiler` supports a single compilation, which might be
 * incremental.
 *
 * `NgCompiler` is lazy, and does not perform any of the work of the compilation until one of its
 * output methods (e.g. `getDiagnostics`) is called.
 *
 * See the README.md for more information.
