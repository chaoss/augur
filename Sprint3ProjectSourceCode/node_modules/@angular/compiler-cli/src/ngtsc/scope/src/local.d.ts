 * to traverse or validate the NgModule graph (imports, exports, etc). After analysis, one of
 * `getScopeOfModule` or `getScopeForComponent` can be called, which traverses the NgModule graph
 * and applies the NgModule logic to generate a `LocalModuleScope`, the full scope for the given
 * module or component.
 *
 * The `LocalModuleScopeRegistry` is also capable of producing `ts.Diagnostic` errors when Angular
 * semantics are violated.
