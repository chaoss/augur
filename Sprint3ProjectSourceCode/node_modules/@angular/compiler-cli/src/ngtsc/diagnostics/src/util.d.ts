 * During formatting of `ts.Diagnostic`s, the numeric code of each diagnostic is prefixed with the
 * hard-coded "TS" prefix. For Angular's own error codes, a prefix of "NG" is desirable. To achieve
 * this, all Angular error codes start with "-99" so that the sequence "TS-99" can be assumed to
 * correspond with an Angular specific error code. This function replaces those occurrences with
 * just "NG".
