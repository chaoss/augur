 * fail also, so we don't need ngcc to catch this.
 *
 * For example, consider an application that uses the `@angular/router` package.
 * This package includes an entry-point called `@angular/router/upgrade`, which has a dependency
 * on the `@angular/upgrade` package.
 * If the application never uses code from `@angular/router/upgrade` then there is no need for
 * `@angular/upgrade` to be installed.
 * In this case the ngcc tool should just ignore the `@angular/router/upgrade` end-point.
