 * This is a very cut-down implementation of the TypeScript module resolution strategy.
 *
 * It is specific to the needs of ngcc and is not intended to be a drop-in replacement
 * for the TS module resolver. It is used to compute the dependencies between entry-points
 * that may be compiled by ngcc.
 *
 * The algorithm only finds `.js` files for internal/relative imports and paths to
 * the folder containing the `package.json` of the entry-point for external imports.
 *
 * It can cope with nested `node_modules` folders and also supports `paths`/`baseUrl`
 * configuration properties, as provided in a `ts.CompilerOptions` object.
