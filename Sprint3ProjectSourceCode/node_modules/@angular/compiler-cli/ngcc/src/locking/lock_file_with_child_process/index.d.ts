/**
 * This `LockFile` implementation uses a child-process to remove the lock file when the main process
 * exits (for whatever reason).
 *
 * There are a few milliseconds between the child-process being forked and it registering its
 * `disconnect` event, which is responsible for tidying up the lock-file in the event that the main
 * process exits unexpectedly.
 *
 * We eagerly create the unlocker child-process so that it maximizes the time before the lock-file
 * is actually written, which makes it very unlikely that the unlocker would not be ready in the
 * case that the developer hits Ctrl-C or closes the terminal within a fraction of a second of the
 * lock-file being created.
 *
 * The worst case scenario is that ngcc is killed too quickly and leaves behind an orphaned
 * lock-file. In which case the next ngcc run will display a helpful error message about deleting
 * the lock-file.
