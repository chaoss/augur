 * getBasePaths('/node_modules', {baseUrl: '/dist', paths: {'*': ['lib/*', 'lib/generated/*']}})
 * > ['/node_modules', '/dist/lib']

 * @param sourceDirectory The standard base-path (e.g. node_modules).
 * @param pathMappings Path mapping configuration, from which to extract additional base-paths.
