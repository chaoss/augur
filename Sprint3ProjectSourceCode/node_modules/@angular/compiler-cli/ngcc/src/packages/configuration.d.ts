 * * Default level - ngcc comes with built-in configuration for well known cases.
 * * Package level - a library author publishes a configuration with their package to fix known
 *   issues.
 * * Project level - the application developer provides a configuration that fixes issues specific
 *   to the libraries used in their application.
 *
 * Ngcc will match configuration based on the package name but also on its version. This allows
 * configuration to provide different fixes to different version ranges of a package.
 *
 * * Package level configuration is specific to the package version where the configuration is
 *   found.
 * * Default and project level configuration should provide version ranges to ensure that the
 *   configuration is only applied to the appropriate versions of a package.
 *
 * When getting a configuration for a package (via `getConfig()`) the caller should provide the
 * version of the package in question, if available. If it is not provided then the first available
 * configuration for a package is returned.
