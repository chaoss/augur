/**
 * Ensures that classes that are provided as an Angular service in either `NgModule.providers` or
 * `Directive.providers`/`Component.viewProviders` are decorated with one of the `@Injectable`,
 * `@Directive`, `@Component` or `@Pipe` decorators, adding an `@Injectable()` decorator when none
 * are present.
 *
 * At least one decorator is now mandatory, as otherwise the compiler would not compile an
 * injectable definition for the service. This is unlike View Engine, where having just an unrelated
 * decorator may have been sufficient for the service to become injectable.
 *
 * In essence, this migration operates on classes that are themselves an NgModule, Directive or
 * Component. Their metadata is statically evaluated so that their "providers"/"viewProviders"
 * properties can be analyzed. For any provider that refers to an undecorated class, the class will
 * be migrated to have an `@Injectable()` decorator.
 *
 * This implementation mirrors the "missing-injectable" schematic.
