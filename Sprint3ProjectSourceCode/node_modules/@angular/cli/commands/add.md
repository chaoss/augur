Adds the npm package for a published library to your workspace, and configures
the project in the current working directory (or the default project if you are
not in a project directory) to use that library, as specified by the library's schematic.
For example, adding `@angular/pwa` configures your project for PWA support:
```bash
ng add @angular/pwa
```

The default project is the value of `defaultProject` in `angular.json`.
