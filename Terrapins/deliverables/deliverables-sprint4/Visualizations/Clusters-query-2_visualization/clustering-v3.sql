Here's an even better one, with some additional data on issue events and pull request events. You do not HAVE to use that data, but it gives you more options for visualization. ```-- clustering
/**
This query shows the most recent cluster id for repos in a cluster. The field is `cluster_content`.
Also shown are the total number of messages per repo.
Also shown are the total number of issue events per repo
Also shown are the total number of pull request events per repo. 

The field `msg_cluster_id` is not meaningful. Its necessary to ensure only the most recent cluster
for each repository is shown. 

The use of out joins will ensure that all repositories have a record. There are a significant 
number of cases in open source software where there are too few messages against a repository 
for them to be part of a cluster in a collection of repositories.
