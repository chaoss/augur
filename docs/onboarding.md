## Onboarding Guide for New Augur Contributors

This guide collects suggested steps and resources to help a newcomer become a confident Augur contributor. It is a living document — please open issues or submit PRs to improve it.

### Join the community, learn how things work
- Join CHAOSS community Slack and introduce yourself: https://chaoss.community/kb-getting-started/
- Read CHAOSS getting-started docs, the Code of Conduct, and other materials on the CHAOSS website.
- Read the repository `CONTRIBUTING.md` — it contains important contribution guidelines (including our AI contribution policy once #3371 is merged).
- Find the project calendar and attend meetings (recommended: newcomer hangout, community call, Software WG, Data Science WG).
- Watch recorded meetings on the CHAOSS YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@CHAOSStube

### Run Augur locally
- Read the docs at https://oss-augur.readthedocs.io/en/main/, especially the Docker setup and development guides.
- Get Augur running on your machine. If docs are unclear or out of date, ask on Slack, open an issue, or submit a PR to fix them.
- There are community videos that show setup steps — check the CHAOSS YouTube for walkthroughs.

### Look for starter issues
- Browse issues tagged `good first issue` or `first-timers-only` in this repo.
- Try a small issue to get familiar with the codebase and the PR process.
- If you want to work on something that doesn't have an issue yet, open an issue describing the problem and discuss it with us before starting.

### Need help?
- Ask on Slack, bring questions to meetings, or comment on an issue/PR where you need guidance. Maintainers and community members are happy to help.

### Want more challenging work?
- Look for issues tagged `challenging first issue`, or explore issues labeled `documentation` or `tech debt` for smaller scoped tasks inside larger efforts.
- Ask on Slack about tasks that match your skills and interests — the community can help point you to a good fit.
