## Augur Setup

# OSX: Note: This has **ONLY** been tested on Apple Silicon with Python 3.11 at this time
## For OSX You Need to make sure to install XCode Command line tools: 
```shell
xcode-select --install
```

*WARNING: rabbitmq, redis, and postgresql will, by default, set themselves up to automatically start when your computer starts. This can be a significant battery drain if you are on battery and not using Augur. For those reasons, go into your system preferences, startup items menu (wherever it is now, because Apple changes it more than Zoolander changes outfits), and turn those "autostart" options off. :)*

*NOTE: If you do not shutoff rabbitmq and redis at the command line before shutting down, they will restart themselves anyway on restart. `brew services stop rabbitmq ;brew services stop redis;`*

### You also need to install these libraries if you are using apple silicon as of June, 2023
brew install gfortran;
brew install llvm;
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc;
brew install Pkg-config;
brew install openblas;

### Add these lines to your .zshrc file: 
```shell
export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/include"
export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/openblas/lib "$LDFLAGS
export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/openblas/include "$CPPFLAGS
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openblas/lib/pkgconfig"

```

## Git Platform Requirements (Things to have setup prior to initiating installation.)
1. Obtain a GitHub Access Token: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Obtain a GitLab Access Token: https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens

### Fork and Clone Augur
1. Fork https://github.com/chaoss/augur 
2. Clone your fork. We recommend creating a `github` directory in your user's base directory. 

## Pre-Requisite Operating System Level Packages
Here we ensure your system is up to date, install required python libraries, install postgresql, and install our queuing infrastrucutre, which is composed of redis-server and rabbitmq-server

### Executable
```shell 
brew update ; 
brew upgrade ; 
brew install rabbitmq ; 
brew install redis ;
brew install postgresql@14 ;
brew install python3-yq ; 
brew install python@3.11 ;
brew install postgresql@14 ; 
brew install go ; #required: Go Needs to be version 1.19.x or higher.
brew install nginx ; # required for hosting
brew install geckodriver; 

# You will almost certainly need to reboot after this. 
```


### RabbitMQ Configuration
The default timeout for RabbitMQ needs to be set.
```shell
sudo vi /opt/homebrew/etc/rabbitmq/advanced.config
```

Add this one line to that file (the period at the end matters): 
```shell
[ {rabbit, [ {consumer_timeout, undefined} ]} ].
```

### Rabbitmq Broker Configuration
You have to setup a specific user, and broker host for your augur instance. You can accomplish this by running the below commands:
```shell
rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management;
rabbitmqctl add_user augur password123;
rabbitmqctl add_vhost augur_vhost;
rabbitmqctl set_user_tags augur augurTag administrator;
rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p augur_vhost augur ".*" ".*" ".*";
```

### Updating your Path: Necessary for rabbitmq on OSX
#### for macOS Intel
`export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/sbin`
#### for Apple Silicon
`export PATH=$PATH:/opt/homebrew/sbin`

***These should be added to your .zshrc or other environment file loaded when you open a terminal***

#### for macOS Intel
`export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH`
#### for Apple Silicon
`export PATH=$PATH:/opt/homebrew/sbin:$PATH`

- We need rabbitmq_management so we can purge our own queues with an API call 
- We need a user
- We need a vhost
- We then set permissions 

NOTE: it is important to have a static hostname when using rabbitmq as it uses hostname to communicate with nodes.

If your setup of rabbitmq is successful your broker url should look like this:

**broker_url = `amqp://augur:password123@localhost:5672/augur_vhost`**

You will be asked for the broker URL on install of Augur. You can copy and paste the line above (`amqp://augur:password123@localhost:5672/augur_vhost`) if you created the users and virtual hosts under "Broker Configuration", above. 

## Things to start before augur later
```shell
brew services start rabbitmq ;
brew services start redis;
brew services start postgresql@14;
```
### If Issues Starting rabbitmq
If you get this error: 
```
brew services start rabbitmq
Bootstrap failed: 5: Input/output error
Try re-running the command as root for richer errors.
Error: Failure while executing; `/bin/launchctl bootstrap gui/501 /Users/sean/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.rabbitmq.plist` exited with 5.
```

Execute this command: 
```
launchctl unload -w /Users/sean/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.rabbitmq.plist
```
Replace the specific path with the one after `/Users/sean/Library/LaunchAgents/` in your error message. This was tested on Apple Silicon. 

## Git Configuration
There are some Git configuration parameters that help when you are cloning repos over time, and a platform prompts you for credentials when it finds a repo is deleted:
```shell 
    git config --global diff.renames true;
    git config --global diff.renameLimit 200000;
    git config --global credential.helper cache;
    git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=9999999999999';
```


## Postgresql Configuration
Create a PostgreSQL database for Augur to use
```shell
... really varies depending how you installed postgres. TBD
```

Then, from within the resulting postgresql shell: 
```sql
CREATE DATABASE augur;
CREATE USER augur WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE augur TO augur;
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO augur;
```

After that, return to your user by exiting `psql`
```
postgres=# \quit
```

Here we want to start an SSL connection to the `augur` database on port 5432:
```shell
psql -h localhost -U postgres -p 5432
```

Now type `exit` to log off the postgres user, and `exit` a SECOND time to log off the root user.
```shell
exit
exit 
```

### RabbitMQ Developer Note:
These are the queues we create: 
- celery (the main queue)
- secondary
- scheduling 

The endpoints to hit to purge queues on exit are: 
```
curl -i -u augur:password123 -XDELETE http://localhost:15672/api/queues/augur_vhost/celery

curl -i -u augur:password123 -XDELETE http://localhost:15672/api/queues/augur_vhost/secondary

curl -i -u augur:password123 -XDELETE http://localhost:15672/api/queues/augur_vhost/scheduling
```

We provide this functionality to limit, as far as possible, the need for sudo privileges on the Augur operating system user.  With sudo, you can accomplish the same thing with (Given a vhost named AugurB [case sensitive]): 

1. To list the queues
```
rabbitmqctl list_queues -p AugurB name messages consumers
```

2. To empty the queues, simply execute the command for your queues. Below are the 3 queues that Augur creates for you: 
```
rabbitmqctl purge_queue celery -p augur_vhost
rabbitmqctl purge_queue secondary -p augur_vhost
rabbitmqctl purge_queue scheduling -p augur_vhost
```


Where augur_vhost is the vhost. The management API at port 15672 will only exist if you have already installed the rabbitmq_management plugin. 

**During Augur installation, you will be prompted for this broker_url**

## Installing and Configuring Augur!
Create a Python Virtual Environment `python3 -m venv ~/virtual-env-directory` 

Activate your Python Virtual Environment `source ~/virtual-env-directory/bin/activate`

From the root of the Augur Directory, type `make install`. You will be prompted to provide:

- "User" is the PSQL database user, which is `augur` if you followed instructions exactly
- "Password" is the above user's password
- "Host" is the domain used with nginx, e.g. `ai.chaoss.io`
- "Port" is 5432 unless you reconfigured something
- "Database" is the name of the Augur database, which is `augur` if you followed instructions exactly
- The GitHub token created earlier
- Then the username associated with it
- Then the same for GitLab
- and finally a directory to clone repositories to

## Post Installation of Augur

### Redis Broker Configuration
If applications other than Augur are running on the same server, and using `redis-server` it is important to ensure that Augur and these other applications (or additional instances of Augur) are using distinct "cache_group". You can change from the default value of zero by editing the `augur_operations.config` table directly, looking for the "Redis" section_name, and the "cache_group" setting_name. This SQL is also a template: 
```sql
UPDATE augur_operations.config 
SET value = 2
WHERE
section_name='Redis' 
AND 
setting_name='cache_group';
```

#### What does Redis Do?
Redis is used to make the state of data collection jobs visible on an external dashboard, like Flower. Internally, Augur relies on Redis to cache GitHub API Keys, and for OAuth Authentication. Redis is used to maintain awareness of Augur's internal state.

#### What does RabbitMQ Do?
Augur is a distributed system. Even on one server, there are many collection processes happening simultaneously. Each job to collect data is put on the RabbitMQ Queue by Augur's "Main Brain". Then independent workers pop messages off the RabbitMQ Queue and go collect the data. These tasks then become standalone processes that report their completion or failure states back to the Redis server. 


**Edit** the `/etc/redis/redis.conf` file to ensure these parameters are configured in this way: 
```shell
supervised systemd
databases 900
maxmemory-samples 10
maxmemory 20GB
```

**NOTE**: You may be able to have fewer databases and lower maxmemory settings. This is a function of how many repositories you are collecting data for at a given time. The more repositories you are managing data for, the close to these settings you will need to be. 

**Consequences** : If the settings are too low for Redis, Augur's maintainer team has observed cases where collection appears to stall. (TEAM: This is a working theory as of 3/10/2023 for Ubuntu 22.x, based on EC2 experiments.)

## (OPTIONAL: NOT FOR DEV: Proxying Augur through Nginx)
Assumes nginx is installed. 

Then you create a file for the server you want Augur to run under in the location of your `sites-enabled` directory for nginx. In this example, Augur is running on port 5038: (the long timeouts on the settings page is for when a user adds a large number of repos or orgs in a single session to prevent timeouts from nginx)

#### For MacOS Intel: 
This gist explains where sites-enabled is: `https://gist.github.com/jimothyGator/5436538`

Logs for nginx should go in this directory: 

`mkdir /Library/Logs/nginx`

`/Library/Logs/nginx`

#### For Apple Silicon: 
There is no `sites-enabled` directory. Server configurations go here: `/opt/homebrew/etc/nginx/servers`

Logs for nginx should go in this directory: `/opt/homebrew/var/log/nginx`

```
server {
        server_name  ai.chaoss.io;

        location /api/unstable/ {
                proxy_pass http://ai.chaoss.io:5038;
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
        }

        location / {
                proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5038;
        }

        location /settings {

                proxy_read_timeout 800;
                proxy_connect_timeout 800;
                proxy_send_timeout 800;
        }

        error_log /var/log/nginx/augurview.osshealth.error.log;
        access_log /var/log/nginx/augurview.osshealth.access.log;

}

```

### (OPTIONAL: NOT FOR DEV) Setting up SSL (https)
Install Certbot: **NOTE: certbot does not currently run on Apple Silicon, as it is looking for information in MacOS Intel directories**
```
brew update;
brew upgrade;
brew install certbot;
brew install openssl; 
brew install brew install python-typing-extensions
```

Generate a certificate for the specific domain for which you have a file already in the sites-enabled directory for nginx (located at `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled` on Ubuntu): 
```
 brew certbot -v --nginx  -d ai.chaoss.io
```

In the example file above. Your resulting nginx sites-enabled file will look like this: 

```
server {
        server_name  ai.chaoss.io;

        location /api/unstable/ {
                proxy_pass http://ai.chaoss.io:5038;
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
        }

   location / {
      proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5038;
   }

   location /settings {

                proxy_read_timeout 800;
                proxy_connect_timeout 800;
                proxy_send_timeout 800;
   }

        error_log /var/log/nginx/augurview.osshealth.error.log;
        access_log /var/log/nginx/augurview.osshealth.access.log;

    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/ai.chaoss.io/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/ai.chaoss.io/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot

}

server {
    if ($host = ai.chaoss.io) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot


        listen 80;
        server_name  ai.chaoss.io;
    return 404; # managed by Certbot


}
```

#### Possible EC2 Configuration Requirements

With virtualization there may be issues associated with redis-server connections exceeding available memory. In these cases, the following workarounds help to resolve issues. 

Specifically, you may find this error in your augur logs: 
```shell
redis.exceptions.ConnectionError: Error 111 connecting to 127.0.0.1:6379. Connection refused.
```

**INSTALL** `sudo apt install libhugetlbfs-bin`

**COMMAND**: 
```
sudo hugeadm --thp-never &&
sudo echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
```


```shell
sudo vi /etc/rc.local
```

**paste** into `/etc/rc.local`
```shell
if test -f /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled; then
   echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
fi
```


**EDIT** : `/etc/default/grub` add the following line: 
```shell
GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=true
```


## Postgresql Configuration
Your postgresql instance should optimally allow 1,000 connections: 

```shell
max_connections = 1000                  # (change requires restart)
shared_buffers = 8GB                    # min 128kB
work_mem = 2GB                  # min 64kB
```

Augur will generally hold up to 150 simultaneous connections while collecting data. The 1,000 number is recommended to accommodate both collection and analysis on the same database. Use of PGBouncer or other utility may change these characteristics.  

## Augur Commands

To access command line options, use `augur --help`. To load repos from GitHub organizations prior to collection, or in other ways, the direct route is `augur db --help`. 

Start a Flower Dashboard, which you can use to monitor progress, and report any failed processes as issues on the Augur GitHub site. The error rate for tasks is currently 0.04%, and most errors involve unhandled platform API timeouts. We continue to identify and add fixes to handle these errors through additional retries. Starting Flower: `(nohup celery -A augur.tasks.init.celery_app.celery_app flower --port=8400 --max-tasks=1000000 &)` NOTE: You can use any open port on your server, and access the dashboard in a browser with http://servername-or-ip:8400 in the example above (assuming you have access to that port, and its open on your network.)

If you're using a virtual machine within Windows and you get an error about missing AVX instructions, you should kill Hyper-V. Even if it doesn't *appear* to be active, it might still be affecting your VM. Follow [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68214280) to disable Hyper-V, and afterward AVX should pass to the VM.

## Starting your Augur Instance
Start Augur: `(nohup augur backend start &)`

When data collection is complete you will see only a single task running in your flower Dashboard.

## Accessing Repo Addition and Visualization Front End
Your Augur instance will now be available at http://hostname.io:port_number

For example: http://chaoss.tv:5038 

Note: Augur will run on port 5000 by default (you probably need to change that in augur_operations.config for OSX)

## Stopping your Augur Instance
You can stop augur with `augur backend stop`, followed by `augur backend kill`. We recommend waiting 5 minutes between commands so Augur can shutdown more gently. There is no issue with data integrity if you issue them seconds apart, its just that stopping is nicer than killing. 

### Docker
1. Make sure docker, and docker-compose are both installed
2. Modify the `environment.txt` file in the root of the repository to include your GitHub and GitLab API keys.
3. If you are already running postgresql on your server you have two choices: 
   - Change the port mappings in the `docker-compose.yml` file to match ports for Postgresql not currently in use.
   - Change to variables in `environment.txt` to include the correct values for your local, non-docker-container database.
4. `sudo docker build -t augur-new -f docker/backend/Dockerfile .`
5. `sudo docker-compose --env-file ./environment.txt --file docker-compose.yml up` to run the database in a Docker Container or 
   `sudo docker-compose --env-file ./environment.txt --file docker-compose.yml up` to connect to an already running database.
