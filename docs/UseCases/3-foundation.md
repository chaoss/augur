# Title: 3-foundation

## Background
Open source foundations provide support to open source communities. To provide
effective guidance, a foundation needs to have an accurate understanding of the
current health and sustainability of a community. By regularly checking metrics,
the foundation can pro-actively respond to changing conditions and to
early-indicators. Similarly, foundations can understand the health and
sustainability of a community before agreeing to support it.

## Description
The user (employee) provides a URL to a GitHub repository for a community that
she wants to provide with guidance. The software returns
[metrics](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/oss-health-metrics/metrics)
that indicate the health and sustainability of the repository.

## Triggers (What prompts the use case to start?)
1. A user (employee) seeks to understand the current health and sustainability
   of a repository to devise actionable advice and guidance.

## Actors (Who is involved?)
1. User

## Preconditions (This includes things like “data loaded”. Or, project is flagged as “of interest”; etc.)
1. User provides URL to a GitHub repository

## Main Success Scenario
1. All metrics that can be computed from the provided repository are displayed.

## Alternate Success Scenarios
1. N/A

## Failed End Condition
1. The provided URL points to a non-existent GitHub repository, metrics cannot
   be calculated, and an error message explaining the condition is shown to user.

## Extensions
1. Compare metrics between repositories.

## Steps of Execution (Requirements)
1. The use enters and submits the URL to a GitHub repository.
2. Metrics computed from the provided repository are displayed.

## Dependent Use Cases
1. N/A
