Deployment Guide
====================================

These instructions include commands for Ubuntu.

Step 1 - Install dependencies
-----------------------------

Before we can begin, we'll need to install the following: -
MySQL/MariaDB/PerconaDB - nginx - GNU screen - git - nodejs 7.x.x or
greater - make - gcc (for native node packages)

On Ubuntu you can install them using:

``bash   # Install NodeSource repo for more recent versions of NodeJS   curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -   # Install dependencies   apt install mariadb-server nginx screen git nodejs make gcc``

Step 2 - Create augur user
--------------------------

You'll want to create a user for the augur API server

On Ubuntu:

.. code:: bash

    useradd augur

Step 3 (optional) - Install Anaconda
------------------------------------

It is recommended to install
`Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`__ to use Augur. If
Anaconda is not used, it is recommended to use Augur in a virtual
environment.

First, login as your augur user (``su augur`` if you are root)

Then, to install Anaconda:

.. code:: bash

    wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.4.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
    chmod +x Anaconda3-4.4.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
    ./Anaconda3-4.4.0-Linux-x86_64.sh

Make sure to add Anaconda to your PATH. There is an option in the
installer to add Anaconda to your path automatically. If you did not add
Anaconda to your path at install time, you can run this to add it.

.. code:: bash

    echo "$PATH:$HOME/anaconda/bin" >> ~/.bashrc

Make sure to replace ``$HOME/anaconda/bin`` with the location you
installed anaconda, and ``.bashrc`` with the appropiate ``rc`` file for
your shell.

Step 4 - Install Augur
----------------------

First, login as your augur user (``su augur`` if you are root) and
download the repo:

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/chaoss/augur
    cd augur

Then, install Augur using ``make install``. If you want to help develop
Augur, also run ``make dev-install``.
