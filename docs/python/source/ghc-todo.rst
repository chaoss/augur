GHC Contribution Starters
==============================

Thank you so much for choosing CHAOSS for OSD 2019! We are so excited to have you with us and we can't wait to get you started. Below are some ideas for things we've got in flight or would like to start soon if you want to help us with them. Of course, if you already have an idea of how you want to contribute then please let us know and we will help you make it a reality!

Backend:
- Fix some metrics unit tests
- Help us add some more unit testing!
- Dev database
- Configurable worker installation
- Set up headless install
- Help us us test the documentation!

Frontend:
- Comparing more than one repo (used to work, logic to fix/recover this would need to be changed somewhere in DynamicLineChart.vue)
- Read the ability to filter by date (either reading the commented “more configuration options” part of the CompareControl.vue or moving the date options somewhere more convenient, possibly on the sidebar)
- Alphabetical compare control repositories
- See if very high committers by week statistics are caused by the frontend
- Finish PieChart

Metrics:
- Risk metrics
- Common metrics
- CHAOSS metric parity
