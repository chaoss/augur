Setting up an Augur Server
---------------------------


High Level Steps to Server Installation of Augur 
------------------------------------------------

1. Have a list of repositories and groups you want them to be in, following the format in the files `schema/repo_group_load_sample.csv` and `schema/repo_load_sample.csv`. 
2. Have access to a server that meets the augur installation pre-requistites (python, NodeJS, etc.)
3. Have nginx installed for front end service. You can use another http server, but we have instructions for nginx.
4. Make sure you have a database available, owned by a user who has rights to create tables. 
5. Have a GitHub API Key handy

Detailed Steps
---------------------------

1. Login to your server.
2. Create or activate the Python3 virtual environment for the Augur instance you want to deploy as a public server. 
3. If you have not already done so, clone Augur.
4. Change into that directory
5. ``git checkout dev``, if you want to deploy the latest features. Otherwise remain in the master branch. 
6. Youâ€™ll need a database owned by an Augur user. 
7. ``make install`` ... now is a good time to go get some tea.
8. When you return with your tea, follow the prompts 
        - Respond to the SERVER prompt with localhost 
        - Current standard is to put the repos in a repos/ directory in the root augur directory (these will never get checked in to VC)
9. Load repos, following instructions in docs.
10. If you have more than one instance of Augur, or another service on port 5000, you will need to edit the ``augur.config.json`` to update the Server port.
        - ``sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN`` will show you ports in use if you are not sure 
        - ``sudo ufw status`` will let you know if the port you are looking to have open is available as open through your firewall
        - ``sudo ufw status | grep 5005`` will check to see if port 5005 is open, for example: 
                5005                       ALLOW       Anywhere (this line is the most important)
                5005/tcp                   ALLOW       Anywhere
                5005/udp                   ALLOW       Anywhere
                5005 (v6)                  ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
                5005/tcp (v6)              ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
                5005/udp (v6)              ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
11. In the Frontend block of ``augur.config.json``, set the server to be the domain you want the front end compiled for.  For example, we set ours to ``test.augurlabs.io``.

.. code-block:: json

    {
    "Frontend": {
            "host": "test.augurlabs.io",
            "port": "5003"
        } 
    }

12. Then do a ``make rebuild``.

Next up: configure ``nginx``!
