Scope of the Augur project
==========================

Augur focuses on collecting data from public git-based code hosting platforms ("Forges") such as GitHub and GitLab. This helps us produce data about the health and sustainability of software projects based on the relevant CHAOSS metrics.
The data Augur collects covers more than just code contributions and extends to anything that can be derived from forge data, including comments, change reviews, releases, and other project activity or interactions. 

This scope is intentionally narrower than that of the CHAOSS project as a whole to help keep the Augur project sustainable with the resources available.
Usecases and discussion of perspectives outside this defined scope are still welcome in the CHAOSS community, but may not be a good fit for direct contributions to Augur.
These usecases may work best as a complementary add-on project, new working group, or third-party addon to augur that depends on or extends Augur functionality.
Future expansions of Augur's scope may also bring in these community addons into the main codebase if new resources become available to sustain such expansion.
