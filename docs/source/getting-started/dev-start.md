# Getting Started with Development
1. Augur Documentation: https://oss-augur.readthedocs.io/en/dev/ (Use the dev branch)
2. Follow documentation to install on whatever OS you are most comfortable with (other than windows).
3. Use the "oh my zsh" shell.  It has a lot of nice Git features. https://ohmyz.sh/ 
4. Postgres.app download for mac: https://postgresapp.com/downloads.html 
5. git clone https://github.com/chaoss/augur augur-rdohm 
    - `pwd` will tell you the current working directory.
