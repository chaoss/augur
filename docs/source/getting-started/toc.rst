Choose Your Installation Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Augur offers two primary installation approaches:

**Docker (Recommended for Quickstart)**: The fastest way to get Augur up and running with minimal setup. Ideal for trying out Augur, demonstrations.

**Manual Installation (Recommended for Long-term Use)**: For production deployments, long-term data collection, or development work. We officially support macOS, Ubuntu, and Fedora.

.. note::

    We recommend either using the Docker images or setting up a virtual machine .
