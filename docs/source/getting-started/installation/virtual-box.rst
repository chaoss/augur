Quickstart
===============

Get going fast! Intended for folks familiar with setting up DevOps environments. These instructions were tested using Ubuntu 20.04. Ubuntu 18x is no longer supported because the versions of Python3 available on it are not current. 

:ref:`Complete installation instructions with more complete explanations are located in our "Getting Started" section.<Getting Started>`

PostgreSQL Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Gain access to an Ubuntu 18.04 or later environment and install PostgreSQL. Ubuntu 20.04 is recommended because its long-term support (LTS) window is longer.

.. code-block:: bash

	sudo apt update
	sudo apt upgrade
	sudo apt install software-properties-common
	sudo apt install python3-dev
	sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib postgresql-client
	sudo apt install build-essential


- Create a PostgreSQL database for Augur to use

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo service postgresql start
    $ sudo su -
    $ su - postgres
    $ psql

Then, once you've connected to your PostgreSQL instance:

.. code-block:: postgresql

    postgres=# CREATE DATABASE augur;
    postgres=# CREATE USER augur WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'password';
    postgres=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE augur TO augur;


Install Go
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Two of Augur's workers use the Go programming language, which needs to be installed on your computer. Snap is the easiest way to install Go. If Snap does not work for you, see instructions here: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-go-on-ubuntu-20-04

.. code-block:: bash

	sudo apt update
	sudo apt install snapd
	sudo snap install go --classic

Incase you encounter any problem following the above commands, try doing these first:

.. code-block:: bash

	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -yqq daemonize dbus-user-session fontconfig
	sudo daemonize /usr/bin/unshare --fork --pid --mount-proc /lib/systemd/systemd --system-unit=basic.target
	exec sudo nsenter -t $(pidof systemd) -a su - $LOGNAME
	snap version

If the last command returns successfully, you can try installing Go again using either of the two options above.

Install RabbitMQ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To set up rabbitmq for augur you must install it with the relevant package manager
for your distro. You can find more info on how to install rabbitmq `here <https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html>`_.

After installation, you must also set up your rabbitmq instance by running the below commands:

.. code-block:: bash

	sudo rabbitmqctl add_user augur password123

	sudo rabbitmqctl add_vhost augur_vhost

	sudo rabbitmqctl set_user_tags augur augurTag

	sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p augur_vhost augur ".*" ".*" ".*"

.. note::
	it is important to have a static hostname when using rabbitmq as it uses hostname
	to communicate with nodes.

Then, start rabbitmq server with 
.. code-block:: bash

    sudo systemctl start rabbitmq.service


If your setup of rabbitmq is successful your broker url should look like this:

broker_url = 'amqp://augur:password123@localhost:5672/augur_vhost'

During installation you will be prompted for this broker url.


Python Virtual Environment Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Set up a Python virtual environment (Python 3.8 and above are now required. Python 3.9 and python 3.10 work as well, though we have tested Python 3.9 on more platforms.)
- Clone and install Augur as a regular user.

.. code-block:: bash

	# Ensure you are logged in as your user on Github and change the "<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>" to your Github username (e.g. "sean")
	git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/augur.git
	cd augur/
	sudo apt install make
	sudo apt-get install python3-venv
	python3 -m venv $HOME/.virtualenvs/augur_env
	source $HOME/.virtualenvs/augur_env/bin/activate
	sudo apt install python-pip-whl
	sudo apt install python3-pip
	sudo apt install pythonpy
	python -m pip install --upgrade pip
	make install-dev {Follow prompts. You will need database credentials, a file location for cloned repositories, a GitHub Token, and a GitLab token.}

- Seven sample repositories will load by default. You can delete them if you want to use your repositories by deleting records from the `repo` table first, then deleting the records from the `repo_groups` table.


.. code-block:: bash

	augur --help
	augur db --help
	augur backend --help

Loading Repositories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The commands for loading repos are:

.. code-block:: bash

	augur db add-github-org
	augur db add-repo-groups
	augur db add-repos

We recommend that you test your instance using 50 or fewer repositories before undertaking a more substantial data collection. When you do take on more collection, you can "collect data faster" by adding additional tokens to the `worker_oauth` table in the `augur_operations` schema and increasing the number of workers for the pull request and GitHub worker blocks in the `augur.config.json` file that generates at install.
