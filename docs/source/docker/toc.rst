Docker
=====================

Augur provides several Docker images designed to get you started with our software as quickly as possible. They are:

- ``augurlabs/augur:backend``, our backend data collection and metrics API
- ``augurlabs/augur:frontend``, our metrics visualization frontend
- ``augurlabs/augur:database``, an empty PostgreSQL database with the Augur schema installed
- ``augurlabs/augur:test_data``, a PostgreSQL database loaded with the data used in our testing environment

If you're not familiar with Docker, their `starting guide <https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container>`_ is a great resource.

The rest of this section of the documentation assumes you have a working installation of Docker as well as some familiarity with basic Docker concepts and a few basic Docker and Docker Compose commands.

If this is your first time using Docker with Augur, please follow the instructions in "Getting Started" to set up your environment.
