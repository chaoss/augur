List of Regularly Used Data Tables In Augur
===========================================

**This is a list of data tables in augur that are regularly used and the various workers attached to them.**

    **Commits** - This is where a record for every file in every commit in every repository in an Augur instance is kept. 
        
        * Worker: Facade worker collects, and also stores platform user information in the commits table. 
                
                .. image:: images/commits.png
                   :width: 200

    **Contributor_affiliations** : A list of emails and domains, with start and end dates for individuals to have an organizational affiliation. 
        
        * Populated by default when augur is installed
        * Can be edited so that an Augur instance can resolve a larger list of affiliations. 
        * These mappings are summarized in the dm_ tables. 

                .. image:: images/contributor_affiliations.png

    **Contributor_repo** - Storage of a snowball sample of all the repositories anyone in your schema has accessed on GitHub. So, for example, if you wanted to know all the repositories that people on your project contributed to, this would be the table. 
        
        * *Contributor_breadth_worker* populates this table
        * Population of this table happens last, and can take a long time.

    **Contributors** - These are all the contributors to a project/repo. In Augur, all types of contributions create a contributor record. This includes issue comments, pull request comments, label addition, etc. This is different than how GitHub counts contributors; they only include committers. 
        
        * Workers Adding Contributors: 

            * Github Issue Worker
            * Pull Request Worker
            * GitLab Issue Worker
            * GitLab Merge Request Worker
            * Facade Worker 

                .. image:: images/contributors.png
                   :width: 200

    **Contributors_aliases** - These are all the alternate emails that the same contributor might use. These records arise almost entirely from the commit log. For example, if I have two different emails on two different computers that I use when I make a commit, then an alias is created for whatever the 2nd to nth email Augur runs across. If a user’s email cannot be resolved, it is placed in the unresolved_commit_emails table. Coverage is greater than 98% since Augur  1.2.4. 
        
        * Worker: 
            
            * Facade Worker

    **Discourse_insights** - There are nine specific discourse act types identified by the computational linguistic algorithm that underlies the discourse insights worker. This worker analyzes each comment on each issue or pull request sequentially so that context is applied when determining the discourse act type. These types are: 

        * negative-reaction
        * answer
        * elaboration
        * agreement
        * question
        * humor
        * disagreement
        * announcement
        * appreciation

        * Worker: 
            
            * Discourse Insights Worker

    **Repo_deps_libyear:** (enumerates every package managed dependency) Looks up the latest release of any library that is imported into a project. Then it compares that release date, the release version of the library version in your project (and its release date), and calculates how old your version is, compared to the latest version. The resulting statistic is “libyear”. This worker runs at least once a month, so over time, you will see if your libraries are being kept up to date, or not. 

        * Scenarios: 
            * If a library is updated, but you didn’t change your version, the libyear statistic gets larger
            * If you updated a library and it didn’t get older, the libyear statistic gets smaller. 

        * Worker: 
        
            * deps_libyear_worker
