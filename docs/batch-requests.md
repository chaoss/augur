Batch requests are a collection of API calls sent simultaneously to the GHData backend. They improve application performance by reducing the number of times the server must be contacted to collect a dataset. We plan on adding typical use-cases ("all the data about a given repo", "all activity metrics") to the batch API to make data collection easier for our users.

We're excited about the large performance increase we expect batch requests to provode GHData which will in turn provide our users with a better exploration experience.
