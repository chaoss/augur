## ghdata explained

There are two components to the project right now when you download and run it.

The first is a server, which presents a rest API that can pull a number of datasets and summaries that could be presented in a myriad of ways.  The documentation for that API is here:

https://osshealth.github.io/ghdata/api/

The second is the front end, which at this time is a simple web page that can be found here, once the project is running locally:

http://localhost:8000

Try entering "hadley" as the repo owner and "devtools" as the repo when you fire it up.

## Development and Contribution Pathways.

With these two components of ghdata in mind, it might be helpful to take a step back and look at the project's overall technical architecture.

Then, go ahead and look at some of the items the Linux Foundation and our other stakeholders are interested in measuring with regards to OSS Project Health.
