Sprint 1 Obstacles, Reflection, and Goals

For this sprint we encountered almost no obstacles. Sean was able to get out instance of Augur up and running quickly and easily which allowed us to get an early start on the rest of the sprint. This allowed for more time to plan out the rest of our project and work on the other deliverables for sprint 1. Once we selected out topic, we started working on the planning stage and we were able to figure out our use cases, requirements, and research of HTTP compared to HTTPS. Furthermore, we were able to compile a list of resources that we will be able to use in the future that will help with the coming sprints. As for our goals, they remain unchanged from when we first started our project. We will start on our design phase soon which lines up with the time line we initially anticipated. This Sprint was very smooth and we are set up to move into sprint 2 effortlessly.
