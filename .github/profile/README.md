Augur is part of the CHAOSS Community, and focuses on the accurate, verifiable collection of open source software health and sustainability data. 

**Through May 18, 2022, Augur will not be issuing new releases. This freeze is due to a highly distributed documentation update effort, and we don't want to have to resolve any more merge conflicts than are necessary**

Great things are coming! Stay Tuned!
