  We're grateful for your contribution and are excited to work with you to make our project even better!

  If you've added any new metrics, please make sure that you've added sufficient documentation and tests. Guides for these things can be found [here](http://augur.augurlabs.io/static/docs/dev-guide/3-backend.html#defining-a-plugin-s-functionality).
  
  Please make sure that all of your commits contain a DCO sign-off. If you'd like more info about DCO, you can find it [here](https://developercertificate.org/).

  We also ask that your commit messages follow a few guidelines for enhanced readability. We ask that commit messages:
   - Separate subject from body with a blank line
   - Limit the subject line to 50 characters
   - Capitalize the subject line
   - Do not end the subject line with a period
   - Use the imperative mood in the subject line
   - Wrap the body at 72 characters
   - Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
