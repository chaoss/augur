#Reflection
I have learned more about how augur works and is developed. I like that it is developed in working groups that are distributed and the development style does not give me the impression of a benevolent dictator for life that some open source projects have.
I learned how to use github issues on a repo, which I have not done before.
I was reminded how to start and augur instance and spent more time than before trying to get it right since I'm going to use the instance for development.
Primary issue I ran into this week was being unable to start sprint 1 early because of other assignments in other classes.
