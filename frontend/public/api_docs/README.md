# Bastards of the Young
## -- Artist, The Replacements

```java
Bastards of Young
The Replacements
God, what a mess, on the ladder of success
Where you take one step and miss the whole first rung

Dreams unfulfilled, graduate unskilled
It beats pickin' cotton and waitin' to be forgotten
We are the sons of no one, bastards of young
We are the sons of no one, bastards of young

The daughters and the sons
Clean your baby womb, trash that baby boom
Elvis in the ground, there'll ain't no beer tonight
Income tax deduction, what a hell of a function

It beats pickin' cotton or waitin' to be forgotten
We are the sons of no one, bastards of young
We are the sons of no one, bastards of young
Now the daughters and the sons

Unwillingness to claim us, ya got no war to name us
The ones, love us best are the ones we'll lay to rest
And visit their graves on holidays at best
The ones, love us least are the ones we'll die to please

If it's any consolation, I don't begin to understand them
We are the sons of no one, bastards of young
We are the sons of no one, bastards of young
Daughters and the sons

Young, young, young, young
Take it, it's yours
Take it, it's yours
Take it, it's yours
Take it, it's yours
Take it, it's yours
Take it, it's yours
Take it, it's yours
Take it, it's yours
Take it, it's yours
```
