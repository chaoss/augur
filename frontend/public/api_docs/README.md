# Bastards of the Young

[Composed and performed by The Replacements](http://thereplacementsofficial.com/pages/home)

```java
God, what a mess, on the ladder of success
Where you take one step and miss the whole first rung
Dreams unfulfilled, graduate unskilled
It beats pickin' cotton and waitin' to be forgotten

We are the sons of no one, bastards of young
We are the sons of no one, bastards of young
The daughters and the sons
Clean your baby womb, trash that baby boom

Elvis in the ground, there'll ain't no beer tonight
Income tax deduction, what a hell of a function
It beats pickin' cotton or waitin' to be forgotten
We are the sons of no one, bastards of young

We are the sons of no one, bastards of young
Now the daughters and the sons
Unwillingness to claim us, ya got no war to name us
The ones, love us best are the ones we'll lay to rest

And visit their graves on holidays at best
The ones, love us least are the ones we'll die to please
If it's any consolation, I don't begin to understand them
We are the sons of no one, bastards of young

We are the sons of no one, bastards of young
Daughters and the sons
Young, young, young, young
Take it, it's yours

Take it, it's yours
Take it, it's yours
Take it, it's yours
Take it, it's yours
Take it, it's yours
Take it, it's yours
Take it, it's yours
Take it, it's yours
```
