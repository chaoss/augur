# Windows x Augur

Navigate to the [instructions](https://github.com/toomanybugs1/tasztm/blob/production/instructions.md) to see how to install Augur on Windows.

You NEED to be running Windows 10 64-bit for this to work. This is because the Linux Subsystem for Windows is only on this version of Windows. If your system doesn't meet these requirements, then you will likely need to use a VM. Goodluck!
