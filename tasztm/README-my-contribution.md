## My Contributions

Because I was the only one in my "group", this accounts for all the work done on my project.

The largest part of this project was actually getting everything running on a Windows environment. This essentially was a complete Augur installation with modified steps. I also had to create documentation on how to get this process running. This included instructions, images, and some common problems and solutions for the specific setup. After the setup and documentation, I tested the instructions on a fresh computer and documented any issues that came up. I also had to test many of the Augur frontend features to make sure it was working properly.
