For Service Providers, VNFSDK will reduce the time and level of testing required to identify, select, and onboard a VNF.  For vendors, VNFSDK will reduce integration efforts by defining a standard for VNF packaging with widespread operator acceptance.  VNFSDK can be used in a validation/conformance testing program in the future.\r\n\r\nVNFSDK delivers automation tools for VNF product specification, packaging, publication and ingestion.\r\nThis project will also deliver a tool for: \r\n\r\n    package validation,\r\n    lifecycle test (framework)\r\n    functional test (framework)\r\n    Reference Repository for VNFs to enable CI/CD without dependency on service provider ingestion	https://wiki.onap.org/display/DW/VNF+SDK+Project	https://gerrit.onap.org/r/#/admin/projects/vnfsdk	Apache-2.0	?	\N	Met	https://wiki.onap.org/display/DW/VNF+SDK+Project\r\nhttps://gerrit.onap.org/r/#/admin/projects/vnfsdk	Met	The description of the project can be found in http://onap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submodules/vnfsdk/model.git/docs/release-notes.html	Met	The following URLs describe the process to join the community, developing the software and provide feekback: \r\nhttps://wiki.onap.org/display/DW/Joining+the+Community \r\nhttps://wiki.onap.org/display/DW/Tracking+Issues+with+JIRA \r\nhttps://wiki.onap.org/display/DW/Developing+ONAP	Met	The process could be found in the following URL: https://wiki.onap.org/display/DW/Development+Procedures+and+Policies\r\n	Met	The Javascript code should meet the requirements except for the number of characters in a line of code specified by the styleguide\r\nhttps://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html\r\nWe avoid the restriction on the number of characters in one line of code to improve readability.

30231	\N	1614	2096	ONAP POLICY	POLICY is the subsystem of ONAP that maintains, distributes, and operates on the set of rules that underlie ONAP’s control, orchestration, and management functions.\r\n\r\nPOLICY provides a logically centralized environment for the creation and management of policies, including conditional rules. This provides the capability to create and validate policies/rules, identify overlaps, resolve conflicts, and derive additional policies as needed.\r\n\r\nPolicies are used to control, influence, and help ensure compliance with goals. Policies can support infrastructure, products and services, operation automation, and security. Users, including network and service designers, operations engineers, and security experts, can easily create, change, and manage policy rules from the POLICY Manager in the ONAP Portal.\r\n\r\nA policy is defined to create a condition, requirement, constraint, decision, or a need that must be provided, evaluated, maintained, and/or enforced. The policy is validated and corrected for any conflicts, and then placed in the appropriate repository, and made available for use by other subsystems and components. Alternately, some policies are directly distributed to policy decision engines such as Drools or XACML. In this manner, the constraints, decisions and actions to be taken are distributed.	https://wiki.onap.org/display/DW/Policy+Framework+Project	https://gerrit.onap.org/r/#/admin/projects/policy	Apache-2.0	?	\N	Met	The project sites are all HTTPS:\r\n\r\nProject site: https://wiki.onap.org/display/DW/Policy+Framework+Project\r\n\r\nRepository: https://gerrit.onap.org/r/#/admin/projects/policy	Met	The description of the project can be found at:\r\n\r\nhttp://onap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submodules/policy/engine.git/docs/platform/index.html	Met	The following URLs describe the process to join the community, developing the software and provide feekback: \r\n\r\nhttps://wiki.onap.org/display/DW/Joining+the+Community \r\n\r\nhttps://wiki.onap.org/display/DW/Tracking+Issues+with+JIRA\r\n\r\nhttps://wiki.onap.org/display/DW/Developing+ONAP\r\n	Met	The process could be found in the following URL: https://wiki.onap.org/display/DW/Development+Procedures+and+Policies	Met	The Javascript code should meet the requirements except for the number of characters in a line of code specified by the styleguide\r\nhttps://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html\r\n\r\nWe avoid the restriction on the number of characters in one line of code to improve readability	Met	https://git.onap.org/policy/drools-pdp/tree/LICENSE.txt\r\n\r\nhttps://git.onap.org/policy/drools-applications/tree/LICENSE.txt\r\n\r\nhttps://git.onap.org/policy/engine/tree/LICENSE.txt\r\n\r\nhttps://git.onap.org/policy/common/tree/LICENSE.txt	Met	The Apache-2.0 license is approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).

AppArmor security policies completely define what system resources individual applications can access, and with what privileges. A number of default policies are included with AppArmor, and using a combination of advanced static analysis and learning-based tools, AppArmor policies for even very complex applications can be deployed successfully in a matter of hours.	https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/wikis/home	https://gitlab.com/apparmor	GPL-2.0 or LGPL-2.0	?	\N	Met	Given only https: URLs.

Obtaining a validation shall be a self-service activity and should be against a reference release of ONAP for use by the VNF provider & any other validation authority.This project at ONAP will not operate as a Validation Authority and will create a process to identify and qualify Validation Authorities. Self-Certification may be considered as a Certification authority option. This project will provide a process to evolve the validation criteria based on experience and as the VN F Requirements & Guidelines evolve. At each release of ONAP, the scope of functionality tested and the test coverage for VNF validation may change. This Project will validate the VNF package integrity and provenance e.g. using signing & attestation. This Project will maintain the authoritative set of tests and test procedures for Validations of VNFs.

The place to report them is <https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues>, and the contact information of the maintainer is at <https://github.com/ropensci/drake/blob/master/DESCRIPTION>.	Met	The contact information of the maintainer is at <https://github.com/ropensci/drake/blob/master/DESCRIPTION>.	Met	Responses to issues are much faster than 14 days. Please refer to the discussion logs at <https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues>.	Met	The installation instructions at <https://ropensci.github.io/drake/#installation> demonstrate how to install the package from the source.	Met	As shown at <https://ropensci.github.io/drake/#installation>, drake can be installed like a typical R package.	Met	In accordance with the community standard, drake only requires formally released R packages on CRAN <http://cran.r-project.org/> to install.	Met	Tests: <https://github.com/ropensci/drake/tree/master/tests>	Met	The tests are in the standard format for R packages, and they are powered by testthat: <http://github.com/r-lib/testthat>. Standard R package quality checks run these tests, as do `testthat::test_package()` and `devtools::test()`. This is the community standard for R packages.	Met	The tests run by `testthat::test_package()`/`devtools::test()` under the default settings run nearly every line of code in nearly every use case of the package. The testing scenarios at <https://github.com/ropensci/drake/tree/master/tests/scenarios> run these tests in several high-performance computing scenarios in different environments.	Met	Policy for new functionality: https://github.com/ropensci/drake/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md. New tests for the functionality are added to the existing unit test suite, and these tests are checked with continuous integration in a pull request before being merged into the project.	Met	The pull requests <https://github.com/ropensci/drake/pulls> and commit history <https://github.com/ropensci/drake/commits/master> provide this evidence.	Met	The contribution instructions at <https://github.com/ropensci/drake/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md> explicitly state the need for new tests in the checklist.  	Met	The lintr package <https://github.com/jimhester/lintr> is invoked by Travis CI <https://github.com/ropensci/drake/blob/master/.travis.yml#L44> for every commit and pull request with successful tests. If any lints are found, a lint bot sends notifications to the GitHub page.	Met	Travis CI and Appveyor CI detect warnings in installation and testing, and notifications are sent to the maintainer's email and the GitHub page.	Met	Both Travis CI and Appveyor CI are configured to fail if any warnings are detected in the package quality checks and tests: <https://github.com/ropensci/drake/blob/master/.travis.yml#L44>, <https://github.com/ropensci/drake/blob/b03800e020b0396cfd76dfa4f01ce6d6609397a6/appveyor.yml#L52>	Met	The code base is decomposed into small, uncomplicated functions, and all the user-side functions are documented thoroughly. Nearly the entire code base was written by the current primary maintainer, and incoming contributions are carefully reviewed line by line with a pull request mechanism. Any attempts to sabotage the code are easy to detect.	Met	The primary maintainer is highly proficient in R, the language of the implementation, and is able to recognize the errors that lead to vulnerabilities in R packages.

As you can see, we usually fix bugs in a matter of hours/days. If it's a major issue, we usually have a release in the following day.	Met	Same thing as above, see https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/labels/enhancement -> we have 5 enhancements requests open and 443 closed. They are usually done within a week.	Met	We use the issue tracker for that https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues - everything is available and searchable there	Met	See https://www.jhipster.tech/help/ -> usually people just submit a bug report, but sometimes if that's really urgent they contact us on Twitter	N/A	We don't have private vulnerability reports, everything is public on the project.	Met	Usually we do this in the next day, never more than 3 days for sure.

The live report is at https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=io.github.jhipster.sample%3Ajhipster-sample-application (it's re-generated with each commit)	Met	It's requirement in https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submit and also the code must pass the Sonar quality gate at https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=io.github.jhipster.sample%3Ajhipster-sample-application	Met	We don't allow major features without tests. Anyway it wouldn't pass the Sonar quality gate at https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=io.github.jhipster.sample%3Ajhipster-sample-application	Met	The rule is at https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submit	Met	We have a lint in our test suite at https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/tree/master/test - it's just not possible to pass the tests (that's the first test in our Travis test) if there is a lint error	N/A	We don't allow warnings, see the above section about the "lint", it can't go pass the tests, so the PR will not be processed	Met	We are very strict and don't allow them at all	Met	I'm the lead developer so I'm the primary developer. I've got 20 years of experience, worked for several very high security systems (including several software for the French central bank), and I am a Java Champion (see https://community.oracle.com/community/technology_network_community/java/java-champions ).\r\nIn the core team we also have Matt Raible, who is also a Java Champion, and who works for https://www.okta.com/	Met	As written above, me & Matt Raible are worldwide recognized experts in that field.	Met	As you can see in https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/blob/master/generators/server/templates/src/main/java/package/security/jwt/TokenProvider.java.ejs we use `java.security.Key` as well as strong encryption provided by https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt for securing our tokens. FYI the algorithm is HMAC-SHA-512. This is done with the help of Okta, where Matt Raible and the lead JJWT developer both work.	Met	See above, that's the case in https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/blob/master/generators/server/templates/src/main/java/package/security/jwt/TokenProvider.java.ejs	Met	Yes https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt is FLOSS	Met	That's provided by https://github.com/jwtk/jjwt - the library will fail if you provide a key which is too short. So for HMAC-SHA-512 (our algorithm) this is 512 bytes.\r\nAnd if the library fails our software does not start, of course.	Met	This is HMAC-SHA-512 and that's not broken yet	N/A	This doesn't make sense for us, this is for securing a webapp and the default validity for a key is 30 minutes...	Met	Yes, when a password is stored, it is hashed with Bcrypt, see https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/blob/4623dea96ad39d561732d422351674b11b415e4c/generators/server/templates/src/main/java/package/config/SecurityConfiguration.java.ejs#L193	Met	We use the crypto function from NodeJS to generate the key, see https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/blob/4a3184ae352cec0a26f696d75a4c34992552a654/generators/server/prompts.js#L288\r\nBut we recommend our users to generate their own key and not use this one, which is just there for development purpose	Met	We provide full documentation and support for TLS, see https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/blob/v5.2.1/generators/server/templates/src/main/resources/config/application-prod.yml.ejs#L206	Met	If you follow our documentation above, this is not possible as you use TLS	Met	You can check at https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues there's nothing at the moment	Met	Usually we do this 1 to 3 days after a vulnerability	Met	After each commit we have a Sonar analysis on https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=io.github.jhipster.sample%3Ajhipster-sample-application	Met	That's what Sonar does on https://sonarcloud.io/project/issues?id=io.github.jhipster.sample%3Ajhipster-sample-application&resolved=false&types=VULNERABILITY	Met	Yes that's what we do, and in the https://sonarcloud.io/project/issues?id=io.github.jhipster.sample%3Ajhipster-sample-application&resolved=false&types=VULNERABILITY report it's currently empty, with an empty history (and they keep track for the last 30 days)	Met	That's on every commit, this is automatically run by Travis with this script: https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/blob/v5.2.1/travis/scripts/06-sonar.sh	Met	We use OWASP with each major release, even if the tool is pretty bad	N/A	We use JavaScript so that should be good	Met	I'm pretty sure OWASP does this	Met	Yes but OWASP never found anything		2018-08-31T13:05:36.844Z	2018-08-31T14:15:35.470Z	Met	This is HMAC-SHA-512 and it's good as of now	Met	We use Travis at https://travis-ci.org/jhipster/generator-jhipster		Met	https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues	Met	There's no such thing in our GitHub repo.

The technologies include REST APIs to enable CI/CD and system administration, a command-line interface that runs on the desktop (Mac, Linux, Windows) and a Desktop View that renders the mainframe in a familiar Desktop motif.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the core technologies, the project includes a variety of applications like TN3270, Z explorers for accessing files, submitting and retrieving job output as well as a communication framework to enable inter application communication.	https://zowe.org	https://github.com/zowe/zlc	EPL-2.0	?	\N	Met	Given only https: URLs.	Met	Zowe offers modern interfaces to interact with z/OS and allows you to work with z/OS in a way that is similar to what you experience on cloud platforms today. You can use these interfaces as delivered or through plug-ins and extensions that are created by clients or third-party vendors.\r\n\r\nZowe consists of the following main components.\r\n\r\nzLUX: Contains a Web user interface (UI) that provides a full screen interactive experience. The Web UI includes many interactions that exist in 3270 terminals and web interfaces such as IBM z/OSMF.\r\n\r\nExplorer server: Provides a range of APIs for the management of jobs, data sets, z/OS UNIX System Services files, and persistent data.\r\n\r\nAPI Mediation Layer: Provides an API abstraction layer through which APIs can be discovered, catalogued, and presented uniformly.\r\n\r\nZowe CLI: Provides a command-line interface that lets you interact with the mainframe remotely and use common tools such as Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), shell commands, bash scripts, and build tools for mainframe development. It provides a set of utilities and services for application developers that want to become efficient in supporting and building z/OS applications quickly.https://zowe.org\r\n\r\n	Met	https://zowe.org/contribute/	Met	https://zowe.org/code-guidelines-4/	Met	https://zowe.org/code-guidelines-4/	Met	https://github.com/zowe/imperative/blob/master/LICENSE\r\nhttps://github.com/zowe/zlux-platform/blob/master/LICENSE	Met	All software in the Zowe organization is licensed under the Eclipse Public License 2.0\r\n	Unmet	https://zowe.org/contribute/	Met	https://zowe.github.io/docs-site/	Met	https://zowe.github.io/docs-site/	Met	https://github.com/zowe	Met	Repository on GitHub, which uses git. git can track the changes, who made them, and when they were made.

30821	\N	2268	2997	PostgreSQL	PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads. The origins of PostgreSQL date back to 1986 as part of the POSTGRES project at the University of California at Berkeley and has more than 30 years of active development on the core platform.\r\n\r\nPostgreSQL has earned a strong reputation for its proven architecture, reliability, data integrity, robust feature set, extensibility, and the dedication of the open source community behind the software to consistently deliver performant and innovative solutions. PostgreSQL runs on all major operating systems, has been ACID-compliant since 2001, and has powerful add-ons such as the popular PostGIS geospatial database extender. It is no surprise that PostgreSQL has become the open source relational database of choice for many people and organisations.\r\n\r\nGetting started with using PostgreSQL has never been easier - pick a project you want to build, and let PostgreSQL safely and robustly store your data.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.postgresql.org/about/	https://www.postgresql.org	https://git.postgresql.org/git/postgresql.git	PostgreSQL Licence	?	\N	Met	Given only https: URLs.

30876	\N	2332	3071	tpm2-tss	Open Source Software implementation of the TCG TPM2 Software Stack (TSS2).\r\nThe TSS2 project aims to facilitate the use of the Trusted Platform Module by providing various abstraction layers - from top to bottom:\r\n\r\n* Enhanced System API (ESAPI) as described in the [TSS 2.0 Enhanced System API (ESAPI) Specification](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TSS_ESAPI_Version-0.9_Revision-04_reviewEND030918.pdf).\r\nThis API is a 1-to-1 mapping of the TPM2 commands documented in Part 3 of the TPM2 specification.\r\nAdditionally there are asynchronous versions of each command.\r\nIn addition to SAPI, the ESAPI performs tracking of meta data for TPM object and automatic calculation of session based authorization and encryption values.\r\nBoth the synchronous and asynchronous API are exposed through a single library: libtss2-esys.\r\n* System API (SAPI) as described in the [system level API and TPM command transmission interface specification](http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tss_system_level_api_and_tpm_command_transmission_interface_specification).\r\nThis API is a 1-to-1 mapping of the TPM2 commands documented in Part 3 of the TPM2 specification.\r\nAdditionally there are asynchronous versions of each command.\r\nThese asynchronous variants may be useful for integration into event-driven programming environments.\r\nBoth the synchronous and asynchronous API are exposed through a single library: libtss2-sys.\r\n* Marshaling/Unmarshaling (MU) as described in the [TCG TSS 2.0 Marshaling/Unmarshaling API Specification](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TSS_Marshaling_Unmarshaling_API_Version-1.0_Revision-04_review_ENDS030918.pdf).\r\nThis API provides a set of marshaling and unmarshaling functions for all data types define by the TPM library specification.\r\nThe Marshaling/Unmarshaling API is exposed through a library called libtss2-mu.\r\n* TPM Command Transmission Interface (TCTI) that is described in the same specification.\r\nThis API provides a standard interface to transmit / receive TPM command / response buffers.\r\nIt is expected that any number of libraries implementing the TCTI API will be implemented as a way to abstract various platform specific IPC mechanisms.\r\nCurrently this repository provides two TCTI implementations: libtss2-tcti-device and libtss2-tcti-mssim.\r\nThe former should be used for direct access to the TPM through the Linux kernel driver.\r\nThe latter implements the protocol exposed by the Microsoft software TPM2 simulator.\r\n* The [TCG TSS 2.0 Overview and Common Structures Specification](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TSS_Overview_Common_Structures_Version-0.9_Revision-03_Review_030918.pdf) forms the basis for all implementations in this project. NOTE: We deviate from this draft of the specification by increasing the value of TPM2_NUM_PCR_BANKS from 3 to 16 to ensure compatibility with TPM2 implementations that have enabled a larger than typical number of PCR banks. This larger value for TPM2_NUM_PCR_BANKS is expected to be included in a future revision of the specification.	https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss	https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss	BSD-2-Clause	?	\N	Met	Given only https: URLs - feature by Github	Met	https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss/blob/master/README.md	Met	<https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss/blob/master/README.md> and <https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>\r\n	Met	Non-trivial contribution file in repository: <https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>.

It offers native support for a large number of drivers for commonly available PCI cards and USB devices, but the subsystems are also targeted towards Linux based set-top-boxes and embedded devices like mobile phones. \r\n\r\nThe main goal is to develop the Linux Kernel media subsystem.\r\n\r\nWe also develop a series of userspace applications, tools and libraries: v4l-utils, ZBar, Kaffeine, XawTv, TVtime, Camorama, EDID decode, Digital TV tables. While several applications are used primarely by end users, for the developers of the project, their primary goal is to be able to test the Kernel development and to provide userspace libraries to enhance the media subsystem support. 	https://linuxtv.org	https://git.linuxtv.org	GPL-2.0-only	?	\N	Met	Given only https: URLs.

There is a particular emphasis on formats and functionality used in professional, large-scale animation and visual effects work for film.  OpenImageIO is used extensively in animation and VFX studios all over the world, and is also incorporated into several commercial products. In addition to reading and writing many image formats, it also has an extensive set of functionality for image processing, out-of-core large image set management, a paging texture system, and many useful command line image utilities.	https://www.openimageio.org	https://github.com/OpenImageIO/oiio	BSD-3-Clause	?	\N	Met	https://github.com/OpenImageIO/oiio\r\nhttps://openimageio.org\r\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/openimageio/home	Met	https://openimageio.org\r\nhttps://github.com/OpenImageIO/oiio	Met	https://github.com/OpenImageIO/oiio/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md	Met	Non-trivial contribution file in repository: https://github.com/OpenImageIO/oiio/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md	Met	Coding standard in https://github.com/OpenImageIO/oiio/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\nAlso we use clang-format as part of the CI to enforce formatting conventions.\r\n	Met	Non-trivial license location file in repository: <https://github.com/OpenImageIO/oiio/blob/master/LICENSE.md>.

It manages the entire lifecycle of load testing APIs, from creating and managing existing performance tests, to running these tests on a scheduled and on-demand basis, and finally viewing the test results in a highly informative and live built-in report.\r\n\r\nPredator has a simple, one-click installation, built with support for Kubernetes (helm charts), DC/OS (mesosphere universe), and Docker Engine, and can persist the created performance tests and their reports in 5 different databases. It also supports running distributed load out of the box, enabling an unlimited amount of virtual users that can bombard your servers. Bootstrapped with a user-friendly UI alongside a simple REST API, Predator helps developers simplify the performance testing regime.\r\n\r\nhttps://zooz.github.io/predator/images/predator-screens.gif	https://predator-ng.com	https://github.com/Zooz/predator	Apache-2.0	?	\N	Met	Given only https: URLs.

This protocol provides the following novelties. First, it lies on the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that will incorporate several image modalities: 3D magnetic resonance images (MRI), ultrasound (US) or Mammography (MG) views. This is the first methodology that is able to classify a whole exam, containing all the above image modalities.\r\n\r\nIn this project, we are interested to develop a new assistant (i.e. a system that will provide diagnosis support as a second opinion), for other human tissues, besides the breast. This will embrace other anatomies such as the aorta, spinal column, epicardial fat, body fat, heart, lungs, and muscle.	https://github.com/mida-project	https://github.com/mida-project/meta	GPL-3.0	?	\N	Met	Given only https: URLs.
