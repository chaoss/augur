# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently provide security updates for the latest tagged release of Augur.

Older versions are not actively supported. In exceptional circumstances, maintainers may choose to backport fixes on a case-by-case basis.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

**IMPORTANT: Do not report security vulnerabilities using public GitHub Issues or public discussions.**

### Private Disclosure Process

If you discover a security vulnerability in Augur, please report it privately by opening a [New Private Vulnerability Report](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/security/advisories/new). Please fill out the provided advisory template to ensure we have all the details (Impact, Reproduction Steps, and Affected Versions) needed to investigate.

### Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

- **Embargo Period**: We ask that you allow maintainers a reasonable amount of time to investigate and release a fix before public disclosure.
- **Credit**: We will acknowledge your discovery in security release notes (unless you prefer anonymity)
- **Coordination**: We will work with you to coordinate the disclosure and release timeline
- **No Public Issues**: Please do not create public GitHub issues or pull requests for security vulnerabilities
- **Confidentiality**: We treat all vulnerability reports with strict confidentiality

### Security Release Process

When a security vulnerability is confirmed:

1. A fix is developed and tested
2. A security release is prepared
3. Users are notified via security advisories
4. The vulnerability is publicly disclosed only after the patch is released and available

Thank you for helping keep Augur secure!
