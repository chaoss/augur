## About Augur

Augur is focused on prototyping open source software metrics.

Functionally, Augur is a prototyped implementation of the Linux Foundation's [CHAOSS Project](http://chaoss.community) on [open source software metrics](https://github.com/chaoss/metrics). Technically, Augur is a [Flask web application](http://augur.osshealth.io), [Python library](https://oss-augur.readthedocs.io/en/dev/library-documentation/python.html) and [REST server](http://augur.osshealth.io/static/api_docs/) that presents metrics on open source software development project health and sustainability.

## Getting Started

**Please follow the 'Getting Started' guide in our [documentation](https://oss-augur.readthedocs.io/en/master/getting-started/getting-started-toc.html).**

Note: we currently only support (most) UNIX systems. If you would like to use Augur but only have access to a non-Unix system, we recommend setting up an Ubuntu 18.04 VM if you can. 
If this is not feasible for you, please reach out to us at [p9j0r6s0m4a0t8v5@augurlabs.slack.com](mailto:p9j0r6s0m4a0t8v5@augurlabs.slack.com) and we will try to help you come up with a solution. In the meantime, if you have Windows and feel so inclined check out issue [#403](https://github.com/chaoss/augur/issues/403) as a starting point until we can finalize a Windows installation.

## Data Collection

Please [follow the instructions](https://oss-augur.readthedocs.io/en/master/getting-started/usage.html#db) for collecting data about specific repositories of interest. We are also currently working on putting together an easily distributable sample database to enable people to get going faster.

<!-- TODO: link to worker docs once they're done -->
<!-- If you are collecting data of your own, you must [start up the workers](./docs/setup/augur-get-workers-going.md). -->

If you have any issues, please feel free to request to email straight into our slack channel [p9j0r6s0m4a0t8v5@augurlabs.slack.com](mailto:p9j0r6s0m4a0t8v5@augurlabs.slack.com) for new developer support!!
