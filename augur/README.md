# Augur GSoC 2025 Micro-task Demonstration

This repository documents my micro-task contributions to the CHAOSS Augur project, focusing on container security and logging improvements.

## Container Non-Root Implementation

I worked on implementing non-root user execution in Docker containers for enhanced security. The changes include:

1. Created a dedicated `augur` user and group in the container with UID/GID 1000
2. Set up proper permissions for log directories at `/home/augur/.augur/logs`
3. Updated container configurations to run processes as non-root user
4. Implemented proper volume mounting with correct permissions (755)

Key Pull Requests:
- [Container Non-Root User Implementation](https://github.com/KhanRayyan3622/augur/pull/1)

## Logging System Improvements

Enhanced the logging system to work correctly in containerized environments:

1. Fixed log file permissions and ownership for the augur user
2. Implemented proper log directory creation in entrypoint.sh
3. Added log rotation configuration with proper file handling
4. Created test scripts (`test_container_logging.py`) to verify logging functionality

Key Pull Requests:
- [Fix Container Logging Configuration](https://github.com/KhanRayyan3622/augur/pull/2)

## Code Quality Improvements

Additionally, I worked on improving code quality:

1. Removed unused imports from `application/db/lib.py`
2. Cleaned up dead code in `application/logs.py`
3. Fixed pylint issues across multiple files
4. Improved code organization and documentation

Key Pull Requests:
- [Clean Up Unused Imports and Dead Code](https://github.com/KhanRayyan3622/augur/pull/3)

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests to verify the changes:

1. `test_container_logging.py` - Tests logging functionality in containers:
   - Log file creation and permissions
   - Log rotation functionality
   - Different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, ERROR)
   - Database logging integration
2. Docker container startup tests with non-root user
3. Permission verification tests for log directories

## Skills Demonstrated

- Docker container security best practices
- Python logging system configuration
- Test automation and verification
- Code quality improvement and static analysis
- Git/GitHub workflow and PR management
- Technical documentation
- Problem solving and debugging

## Future Work

Areas I plan to work on:
1. Further security enhancements:
   - Implement more granular permissions
   - Add security scanning in CI/CD
2. Additional logging features:
   - Structured logging format
   - Enhanced log rotation policies
3. Continuous integration improvements:
   - Add automated security checks
   - Enhance test coverage
4. Documentation updates:
   - Add architecture diagrams
   - Improve setup instructions
