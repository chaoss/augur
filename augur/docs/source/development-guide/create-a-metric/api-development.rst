Parts of an Augur API Endpoint
=============================

1. Developing the query that will produce data needed to deliver the endpoint, usually parameterized by a `repo_id`.
2. Determining if the endpoint will be a "standard endpoint", or a custom endpoint. 

Where Are the Endpoints? 
------------------------

JSON Metrics are here: 

.. code-block:: bash

   $ AUGUR_HOME/augur/metrics

Visualization Metrics are here: 

.. code-block:: bash

   $ AUGUR_HOME/augur/routes


Existing metrics files (JSON Metric) "Standard Metrics": 
--------------------------------------------------

1. commit.py
2. contributor.py
3. experimental.py
4. insight.py
5. issue.py
6. message.py
7. platform.py
8. release.py
9. repo_meta.py 

All "Standard Metrics" files generally share a set of imports

.. code-block:: python 

   import datetime
   import sqlalchemy as s
   import pandas as pd
   from augur.util import register_metric

You can see that one of the imports is our standard metric import from the util file, which is located in: 

.. code-block:: python 

   AUGUR_HOME/augur/routes/util.py


All "Standard Metrics" share declaration and a method signature

Declaration: 

.. code-block:: python 

   @register_metric()

Method Signature: 

.. code-block:: python 

   def contributors(self, repo_group_id, repo_id=None, period='day', begin_date=None, end_date=None):

Standard metrics also, generally, include default setting blocks for date range, in the event parameters are not passed. 

.. code-block:: python 

    if not begin_date:
        begin_date = '1970-1-1 00:00:01'
    if not end_date:
        end_date = datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')

There is also, generally, a block in a standard metric for pulling data by a repo_id or a repo_group_id. The default is a repo_group_id. Here is an abrdiged example from the contributors endpoint in `contributor.py`

.. code-block:: python 

    if repo_id:
        contributorsSQL = s.sql.text("""
           SELECT id                           AS user_id,

Existing Visualization Metrics Files: 
------------------------------

1. contributor_reports.py
2. pull_request_reports.py


These files are not intended to be all inclusive. Rather, they are what we have developed, or imagined, based on existing CHAOSS metrics to date. New CHAOSS metrics are likely to result in the inclusion of new files under metrics, or routes, depending if they are standard metrics or not.
