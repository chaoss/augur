## Code stubs added in this PR

https://github.com/isaacwengler/augur/pull/7

This adds:

-   Stubs for each endpoint that we are adding
-   Stubs for tests for each endpoint that we are adding

Note: this was merged into `augur-new` to verify that the endpoint stubs are working.

## Team reflection

For this sprint we focused on setting up issues for all of the metrics and created code stubs for each endpoint and tests to make sure the endpoints were working correctly. We were not able to begin working on the SQL queries for the endpoints because we did not have a database with data in `repo_labor` until 11/17. Going forward we are going to construct the SQL queries and then begin working on the API endpoints.
