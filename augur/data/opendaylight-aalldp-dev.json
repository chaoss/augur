            "plain": "Hi AALLDP Team,\n\n\n\n1. Does your project have any plans to be archived?  If your project has no plans for any future active development, project committers can vote to move a project to the Archived State by a Termination Review according to the OpenDaylight Project Lifecycle and Releases document [1].\n\n2. If you projects plans to remain active, does it intend to participate in the Boron Simultaneous Release as documented in the Boron Release Plan [2]?  If not, could someone please publicly decline to participate with a message like so: \"The <PROJECT_NAME> project is formally declining to participate in the Boron SR\".\n\n\n\nThere are no project related activity on Gerrit.\n\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\nAn Ho\n\n\n\n[1] https://www.opendaylight.org/project-lifecycle-releases\n\n[2] https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Simultaneous_Release:Boron_Release_Plan\n\n\n-------------- next part --------------\nAn HTML attachment was scrubbed...\nURL: <http://lists.opendaylight.org/pipermail/aalldp-dev/attachments/20160324/6e137881/attachment.html>\n"
