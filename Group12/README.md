# Group 12

This directory contains the contributions of group 12 towards Augur. The `docs` directory contains the documentation we created on how to set up an Amazon EC2 instance and install Augur's dependencies.

## Documentation Installation Guide

### Build Requirements
- [Python 3.X](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Python 3.X")
- [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/ "PIP")
- [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html "Sphinx")
- [sphinx-rtd-theme](https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme "sphinx-rtd-theme")

### Build Instructions
To build the HTML docs, run the following the command in a terminal situated in the `docs` directory:

`make html`

This will build the HTML docs in the `docs/build` directory. To view the newly generated HTML docs, open the file located in `docs/build/html/index.html` in a web browser.
