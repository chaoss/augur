Amazon AWS Requirements
=======================
First, developers wanting to use Augur to analyze the health and sustainability of GitHub repositories will need an Amazon AWS account in order to create an EC2 instance to host Augur. The Amazon AWS account must have credits in order to host the server and deploy Augur. In the case that a user does not have experience using Amazon AWS, our documentation will show users how to set up an AWS instance.

If you do not have an Amazon AWS account, you can follow Amazonâ€™s own guide `here <https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/>`_ for a step-by-step process on how to create one.

Amazon EC2 Instance Requirements
--------------------------------
The following requirements must be met when creating your Amazon EC2 Instance for the installation of Augur:

- Ubuntu Server 20.4 or newer AMI
- At least 30GB of storage space
- At least 4GB of RAM

Once you have your Amazon AWS account set up with credits, you may proceed to the next section on creating the Amazon EC2 instance.
