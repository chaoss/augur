### Obstacles & Reflection
- Errors running make install because didn't install wheel package (pip install wheel), python.h (sudo apt-get install python3-dev), tensorflow (pip install â€“upgrade pip)
- Wasn't able to finish installing frontend dependencies using make install because stalled for 30+ minutes after warning
