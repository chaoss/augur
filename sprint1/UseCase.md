## Title 
(active verb phrase, states main goal)

## Description 
(This may be several paragraphs. Context is important. You are describing the use case in some detail, and since many of the use cases will involve users changing parameters on data visualizations, you should be exceedingly clear about this type of thing.)

## Triggers 
(What prompts the use case to start?)

## Actors 
(Who is involved?)

## Preconditions 
(This includes things like “data loaded”. Or, project is flagged as “of interest”; etc.)

## Main Success Scenario (Goals)
(What does it look like when the user’s work is successful in the system?)

## Alternate Success Scenarios 
(For a data analysis and “data playing” focused project like this one, there could be several different success scenarios for each use case. “Sees visualization” is not a success scenario. “Compares four different projects on “indicator X” and saves “project trackers” for each one could be a success scenario.)

## Failed End Condition 
(“crashes” is not a failed end condition. “User is unable to discern the difference between two projects because they are similar on the available indicators” might be).

## Extensions

## Steps of Execution (Requirements)

## A use case diagram
(following the UML Standard for expressing use cases.)
